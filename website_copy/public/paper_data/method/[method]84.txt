(2007) found that occupational success can be reliably predicted by personality traits, and that among the Big Five, conscientiousness is the best predictor of such success (see Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, &amp; Barrick, 1999). </span><span class="sentence">We did not have direct measures of the average occupational success of nations. </span><span class="sentence">However, one national indicator of economic success is per capita gross domestic product (GDP). </span><span class="sentence">No doubt, a nation's GDP is a complex variable reflecting a variety of historical, political, and sociodemographic factors. </span><span class="sentence">Nevertheless, a country's per capita GDP is related to the occupational success of its citizens, so per capita GDP should correlate with the average conscientiousness of its citizens. </span><span class="sentence">We included per capita GDP as reported in <i>The World Factbook</i> (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007) as a demographic variable in this study.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Personality is also reliably associated with longevity (Roberts et al., 2007), and conscientiousness is the best predictor of longevity among the Big Five. </span><span class="sentence">The average life expectancy of nations was also obtained from <i>The World Factbook</i> (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007). </span><span class="sentence"><sup>1</sup></span></p><p><span class="sentence">We correlated our validity criteria (walking speed, postal workers' speed, accuracy of clocks in public banks, per capita GDP, and longevity) with a variety of measures of conscientiousness. </span><span class="sentence"><sup>2</sup> Specifically, conscientiousness was measured by aggregated self-reports on the NEO-PI-R (McCrae, 2002) and the Big Five Inventory (Benet-Martínez &amp; John, 1998; Schmitt et al., 2007), aggregated peer reports on the NEO-PI-R (McCrae et al., 2005), and average PNC scores from Terracciano et al. (2005). </span><span class="sentence">Table 1 reports the correlations in two ways. </span><span class="sentence">In each cell, the correlation on the left was calculated using pair-wise deletion of data. </span><span class="sentence">These correlations are based on between 17 and 55 countries. </span><span class="sentence">The right-hand correlation in each cell was calculated using case-wise deletion of data, which reduced the sample to the 10 countries for which we had data for all measures. </span><span class="sentence"><sup>3</sup> Although the pair-wise-deletion analyses had a larger sample that was thus more representative of a worldwide sample, the case-wise-deletion analyses allowed for more accurate comparisons across measures, as in these analyses the measures were compared across the same countries.</span></p><div class="NLM_table-wrap"><div class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel">TABLE 1</span> <i>Correlations Between Personality Traits and Behavioral and Demographic Measures of Conscientiousness</i></p></div><img src="/paper_data/img/10.1111_j.1467-9280.2008.02085.x-table1.jpeg" alt="" id="_i3"/></div><p><span class="sentence">The analyses revealed that the aggregate self-report data from the NEO-PI-R correlated negatively with all the validity criteria for both sets of countries (average <i>r</i> = −.43). </span><span class="sentence"><sup>4</sup> Likewise, the aggregate self-report data from the Big Five Inventory correlated negatively with the validity criteria (average <i>r</i> = −.19). </span><span class="sentence">The aggregate peer-report data from the NEO-PI-R showed mixed correlations with the validity criteria. </span><span class="sentence">Overall, the pattern yielded null correlations ( <i>r</i> = .06). </span><span class="sentence">In sum, none of the self-report or peer-report data were reliably associated with the validity criteria in the predicted direction.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In contrast, the PNC data correlated positively and significantly with all five of the validity criteria, with the sole exception of longevity with pair-wise deletions. </span><span class="sentence">The average correlation between the PNC data and the validity criteria was .61. </span><span class="sentence">This is evidence that the PNC data have greater validity for measuring conscientiousness than the aggregate self- and peer-report data do.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The five validity criteria we used are not independent; indeed, the correlations among them ranged from .25 to .71, and the average correlation was .47—a value higher than is typically obtained for correlations among items in trait measures. </span><span class="sentence">One possible explanation for these high interitem correlations is that the behavioral criteria simply reflect the consequences of wealth, and that participating in a wealthy society leads people to work more effectively, walk faster, and live longer. </span><span class="sentence">We therefore recalculated the correlations after partialing out per capita GDP (see Table 2). </span><span class="sentence">The average partial correlation between the NEO-PI-R self-report data and the criteria was weakly negative, as was the average correlation between the Big Five Inventory self-report data and the criteria. </span><span class="sentence">The average correlation between the NEO-PI-R peer-report data and the criteria was weakly positive ( <i>r</i> = .15). </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, the average correlation between the PNC data and the validity criteria was moderately positive ( <i>r</i> = .41), and seven of the eight partial correlations for the PNC data were positive. </span><span class="sentence">In sum, after per capita GDP was partialed out, the aggregate self- and peer-report measures did not reliably predict the remaining validity criteria, whereas the PNC data still showed good validity.</span></p><div class="NLM_table-wrap"><div class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel">TABLE 2</span> <i>Partial Correlations Between Personality Traits and Behavioral and Demographic Measures of Conscientiousness, Controlling for Per Capita Gross Domestic Product</i></p></div><img src="/paper_data/img/10.1111_j.1467-9280.2008.02085.x-table2.jpeg" alt="" id="_i4"/></div>
