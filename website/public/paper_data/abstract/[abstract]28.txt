<span class="sentence">Does moral behavior draw on a belief in free will? Two experiments examined whether inducing participants to believe that human behavior is predetermined would encourage cheating. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, participants read either text that encouraged a belief in determinism (i.e., that portrayed behavior as the consequence of environmental and genetic factors) or neutral text. </span><span class="sentence">Exposure to the deterministic message increased cheating on a task in which participants could passively allow a flawed computer program to reveal answers to mathematical problems that they had been instructed to solve themselves. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, increased cheating behavior was mediated by decreased belief in free will. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 2, participants who read deterministic statements cheated by overpaying themselves for performance on a cognitive task; participants who read statements endorsing free will did not. </span><span class="sentence">These findings suggest that the debate over free will has societal, as well as scientific and theoretical, implications.</span>
