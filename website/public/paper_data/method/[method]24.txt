<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 compares recall performance of lists of phonologically similar items with recall of lists of dissimilar items. The major difference between this and other published studies is the number of participants.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A total of 100 Purdue University undergraduates who were native speakers of American English participated in exchange for course credit.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The to-be-remembered items were 64 one-syllable words used by Surprenant, Neath, and LeCompte (1999) to study PSEs. An example similar list is <em>vote, boat, goat, float, note</em>, and <em>coat</em>. An example dissimilar list is <em>break, sick, vote, greet, rat</em>, and <em>fun</em>. Each word appeared in both similar and dissimilar lists (e.g., <em>vote</em> in the above example). Lists were randomized such that participants saw the same words but in different random orders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were informed that we were interested in how accurately they could remember the order in which a series of words had been presented. Each word was shown in uppercase, center justified, for 1.5 s in the middle of the screen in 20-point Helvetica font. After the final word was shown, six response buttons became active and were labeled with the six words in alphabetical order. The participants were asked to indicate the presentation order by clicking on appropriately labeled buttons using the mouse. For example, if they thought the first word was <em>break</em>, they should click on the button labeled <em>break</em> first. If they thought the third word was <em>vote</em>, they should click on the button labeled <em>vote</em> third. Participants received 20 lists, half with dissimilar and half with similar items, and were informed they could take rest breaks at any point. The order of dissimilar and similar trials was randomly determined for each participant. Participants were tested individually, and an experimenter remained in the room to ensure compliance with the instructions.</p>
