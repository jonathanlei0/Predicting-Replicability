<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Experiment 1 was based on the list-completion procedure (e.g., Allport et al., 1994; Jersild, 1927). </button><button class="sentence">In this procedure three types of lists are presented: (a) a pure list containing only Task A, (b) a pure list containing only Task B, and (c) a mixed list in which participants have to alternate between Task A and Task B. The switch cost is computed as the difference between the mean latencies (and error rates) of both pure lists and the mixed list. </button><button class="sentence">Although this method has proven to be useful in many investigations of task switching (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson &amp; Miyake, 2003; Saeki &amp; Saito, 2004a, 2004b), it is important to note that the cost observed in this situation does reflect a broad range of demands and processes that are not all specific to task switching. </button><button class="sentence">For this reason, it is more appropriate to refer to this cost as a <em>global switching cost</em> (e.g., Kray &amp; Lindenberger, 2000; Mayr, 2001). </button><button class="sentence">An advantage of this method is that the difference between pure and mixed lists is large and robust. </button><button class="sentence">In view of the present purpose, namely finding evidence for an effect of task switching on working memory storage, it seems appropriate to start with such a large effect. </button><button class="sentence">If no difference is observed under these conditions, the search for a cognitive cost associated with more fine grained measures of task switching is futile.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The present experiment compared recall performance in continuous span tasks including either pure lists or mixed lists of tasks. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were presented with a number of consonants to be remembered. </button><button class="sentence">After each consonant, they were presented with a series of digits to be processed according to the list completion paradigm. </button><button class="sentence">Pure lists involved either parity or magnitude judgments, whereas mixed lists required participants to alternate between parity and magnitude judgments of the digits. </button><button class="sentence">We predicted poorer recall in the mixed list than in the pure list conditions.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Nineteen first-year psychology students at Ghent University participated for course requirements and credit. </button><button class="sentence">All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed, and were naïve to the purpose of the experiment.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Tasks and material</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">A continuous span task designed by Barrouillet et al. (2004) was used. </button><button class="sentence">During a continuous span task, two constituent tasks need to be coordinated. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were presented with series of three to six consonants to be remembered. </button><button class="sentence">Consonants in each series were drawn from 13 groups with low intergroup confusability based on their Dutch pronunciation (Vandierendonck, De Vooght, &amp; Van der Goten, 1998). </button><button class="sentence">These groups were: (<em>B, D, P, T</em>), (<em>C</em>), (<em>F, S</em>), (<em>G</em>), (<em>H, K</em>), (<em>J</em>), (<em>L</em>), (<em>M, N</em>), (<em>Q</em>), (<em>R</em>), (<em>V, W</em>), (<em>X</em>), (<em>Z</em>). </button><button class="sentence">After each consonant, a series of eight digits (from 1 to 9, without 5) colored in either red or blue was sequentially displayed on screen. </button><button class="sentence">These series were randomly generated with the restriction that immediate stimulus repetition was avoided. </button><button class="sentence">When the digit was red, the participants had to decide whether it was larger or smaller than 5, by pressing a right or a left key, respectively. </button><button class="sentence">If it was blue, participants judged its parity by pressing the right or the left key for even and odd numbers, respectively. </button><button class="sentence">Previous research has shown that these response mappings are consistent with the mental representations of numbers in long-term memory, thus avoiding spurious compatibility effects (Dehaene, Bossini, &amp; Giraux, 1993; Nuerk, Iversen, &amp; Willmes, 2004). </button><button class="sentence">For both judgments the right hand had to be used.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Three types of digit lists were created: (a) 8 lists containing only parity judgments; (b) 8 lists containing only magnitude comparisons, and (c) 16 mixed lists in which the participants had to alternate between the parity and the magnitude tasks. </button><button class="sentence">In this way, for each length of the letter sequence (three, four, five, or six consonants), 4 simple and 4 mixed lists were presented. </button><button class="sentence">This resulted in a total of 32 lists to be performed.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The participants were tested in groups of two by means of Pentium III personal computers with 17-inch color monitors running the Tscope experimentation software (Stevens, Lammertyn, Verbruggen, &amp; Vandierendonck, 2006). </button><button class="sentence">The instructions were presented on-screen and paraphrased if necessary. </button><button class="sentence">A practice session of three blocks preceded the experimental sessions. </button><button class="sentence">In the first practice block, one letter series of each length was presented, and participants had to memorize the consonants without processing the digits presented after each consonant. </button><button class="sentence">In the second block, participants processed the digits without memorizing the consonants, whereas in the last block, both letter memorization and digit processing had to be performed.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After these three practice blocks, the experiment proper started. </button><button class="sentence">The letter–digit lists were presented in a random order. </button><button class="sentence">The course of events for each list was as follows: First, the length and the type of the list were announced in the middle of the screen (e.g., “4 consonants—magnitude task”). </button><button class="sentence">Second, a consonant was presented for 1,500 ms, followed by a 300-ms blank. </button><button class="sentence">Next, a digit appeared for 900 ms followed by a 300-ms blank. </button><button class="sentence">When the eight digits were presented, the next consonant appeared, and so on. The time course of these events was fixed. </button><button class="sentence">Even when participants did not respond to the digits, the sequence continued. </button><button class="sentence">At the end of a list, participants had to recall the consonants in the correct order by typing the letters on the keyboard with their left hand. </button><button class="sentence">The recalled consonants were presented on a display on-screen. </button><button class="sentence">Whenever the participants had forgotten an item, they pressed the spacebar and a question mark appeared instead of a letter. </button><button class="sentence">The experiment lasted about 1 hr.</button></p>
