<h3>Experiment 5: How Does an Implemental Mind-Set Affect Attitude Strength?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Throughout the previous studies, we have assumed that the mechanism behind an implemental mind-set's affect on attitude strength is the one-sided analysis of information that occurs after a decision is made. </span><span class="sentence">Of course, it is also possible that simply making a decision is sufficient to foster increased attitude strength in general, without necessitating a one-sided focus as the driving mechanism. </span><span class="sentence">Prior mind-set work has never teased apart the act of deciding and the one- versus two-sided focus. </span><span class="sentence">This might not be surprising, however, given that individuals in a postdecisional state generally spontaneously tune their thoughts in a one-sided manner (Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995). </span><span class="sentence">Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to pinpoint the exact mechanism underlying the effect an implemental mind-set has on attitude strength. </span><span class="sentence">The current experiment set out to examine this mechanism, with ambivalence and certainty as the focal aspects of attitude strength to test our hypothesis.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 46 former and current students (25 women, 21 men) recruited via several University of Chicago electronic postings (newsgroup site, Facebook, and listserve notification) who participated for $10. </span><span class="sentence">The procedure for collecting data was the same as that used in Experiments 2 and 4 with the following additions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After receiving the instructions over e-mail, participants were instructed to respond to the study when no other people were around in order to minimize distractions. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: implemental mind-set one-sided focus, implemental mind-set two-sided focus, or neutral mind-set. </span><span class="sentence">There were 15 participants in each of the implemental mind-set conditions and 16 participants in the neutral mind-set condition.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Mind-set manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The procedure used in Experiment 1 to activate an implemental mind-set was applied in the current experiment. </span><span class="sentence">For participants assigned to the implemental mind-set one-sided focus condition, after they read the sample letter they listed three reasons why it could be desirable and easy to give advice on their chosen romantic area. </span><span class="sentence">Note that this one-sided evaluative focus resembles the type of biased processing that has been shown to naturally occur once people enter into the postdecisional phase of goal pursuit (e.g. Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995). </span><span class="sentence">For participants assigned to the implemental mind-set two-sided focus condition, after they read the sample letter they listed three reasons why it could be desirable and easy to give advice on their chosen area and three reasons why it could be undesirable and difficult to give advice on their chosen area. </span><span class="sentence">After listing their reasons, participants in the implemental mind-set conditions responded to the attitude questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">The procedures used in Experiments 3 and 4 to activate a neutral mind-set were applied in the current experiment.  After participants in the neutral mind-set condition described seven things that they normally did during a typical day, they responded to the attitude questionnaire.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Dependent measure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">At the beginning of the attitude questionnaire, participants were asked to indicate their reaction toward a topic that was supposedly being debated within the United States—whether the list of convicted sex offenders should be made available to the general public rather than just the police. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, participants read the following:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">Should the list of convicted sex offenders be made available to the general public rather than just the police? On the one hand, people believe that making the registered sex offender list known to the general public rather than just the police would help citizens decide on where they want to live and where to keep children from playing unsupervised, thereby lowering the incident of future offenses. </span><span class="sentence">On the other hand, people believe that making the registered sex offender list known to the general public rather than just the police would make it so difficult for offenders to find a place to live and work that it would lead offenders to avoid registering as a sex offender in the first place, thereby increasing the incident of future offenses.</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In order to reduce the likelihood that participants already held a strong attitude toward this issue, we excluded 1 participant from the analyses who reported having direct contact with a sex offender in her neighborhood.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We assessed how ambivalent people were toward the issue using the following 7-point rating scales: “I have strong mixed emotions both for and against making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police” (reverse scored) and “I do not find myself feeling torn between the two sides of the issue of making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police,” on scales ranged from −3 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 3 (<em>strongly agree</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were also asked “To what extent are you indecisive when it comes to making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police.” </span><span class="sentence">That scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>). </span><span class="sentence">These items were adopted from previous ambivalence studies (Newby-Clark, McGregor, &amp; Zanna, 2001; Priester &amp; Petty, 1996). </span><span class="sentence">After recoding the scale for the last item to range from −3 to 3, we created an index of ambivalence by averaging responses to the three items (α = .93). </span><span class="sentence">We also assessed how certain people were about their attitude toward the issue using the following 7-point rating scale: “How certain are you about your attitude toward making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police.” </span><span class="sentence">The scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>). </span><span class="sentence">As expected, certainty scores were significantly negatively correlated with ambivalence scores (<em>r</em> = −.69). </span><span class="sentence">Finally, participants' demographics were assessed.</span></p>
