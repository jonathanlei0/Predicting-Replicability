<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The contingency hypothesis presented here holds that participants implicitly learn contingencies and implicitly use them to aid responding. </span><span class="sentence">Further, we proposed a mechanism whereby participants use contingency information to reduce the response threshold for the predicted response. </span><span class="sentence">This account predicts facilitation with no corresponding interference when response latency is the dependent variable but both facilitation and interference when errors are the dependent variable. </span><span class="sentence">Both of these predictions were borne out. </span><span class="sentence">Further, contingency effects operate separately from the Stroop effect, a finding supported by the null interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type. </span><span class="sentence">To further test the contingency hypothesis, in Experiments 1 and 2 we investigate contingency effects in the contingency learning paradigm developed by Schmidt et al. (2007) using color-unrelated words.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">It could be argued that the size of the Stroop effect is only incidentally equivalent in the high, medium, and low contingency conditions. </span><span class="sentence">It could also be claimed that the failure to find increased interference in the high proportion congruent condition and decreased facilitation in the low proportion congruent condition is merely a Type II error. </span><span class="sentence">But the modulation hypothesis rests on the critical assumption that the reason for variations in the size of the Stroop effect is that participants detect the proportion of congruent items. </span><span class="sentence">The contingency hypothesis, on the other hand, makes no such claim. </span><span class="sentence">According to the contingency hypothesis, words and responses merely have to be correlated; color-related words are not necessary to observe contingency effects.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In that vein, Schmidt et al. (2007; see also Musen &amp; Squire, 1993) have reported several experiments that provide further support for the contingency hypothesis interpretation of the ISPC effect by showing that contingency effects can be observed in the absence of a Stroop effect. </span><span class="sentence">In their experiments, color-unrelated words (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>) were presented most often in a given color (e.g., <em>MOVE</em> 75% of the time in blue, <em>SENT</em> 75% of the time in green, etc.). Key press responses were faster to high contingency trials (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>blue) than low contingency trials (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>green). </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the results of these experiments confirm that participants are able to use words (even when they are color-unrelated) to predict what response to make. </span><span class="sentence">This is a critical result, because the modulation hypothesis cannot accommodate these findings given that the words and colors have no congruency relation that can be used to decide whether or not to attend to the word.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiments 1 and 2 use the Schmidt et al. (2007) paradigm to demonstrate contingency effects in the absence of any congruency relations. </span><span class="sentence">These experiments include a medium contingency condition (not used by Schmidt et al.) to demonstrate a facilitation-only pattern in the response latencies (Experiment 1) and facilitation and interference in errors (Experiment 2) to mirror the main effects observed in our reanalyses of Jacoby et al. (2003).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 was a two-choice, rather than a four-choice, task (in part to ensure that the interactions observed by Logan et al., 1984, were not attributable to something more than sequential confounds). </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, several color-unrelated words were presented most often in a randomly assigned color. </span><span class="sentence">For instance, <em>SEVEN</em> might be presented 75% percent of the time in blue and 25% of the time in green. </span><span class="sentence">Other words, for instance <em>CHAIR</em>, were presented in blue and green equally often. </span><span class="sentence">This type of manipulation creates high contingency (.75; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>blue), medium contingency (.50; e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>blue), and low contingency (.25; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>green) trials. </span><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 focuses primarily on response latencies, with the goal of replicating the facilitation-only pattern of results observed in Reanalysis 1.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 2 uses the response deadline procedure used by Jacoby et al. (2003), in which participants are given a very short amount of time to respond so as to maximize errors, and thus the analysis focuses on the error data. </span><span class="sentence">Experiment 2 attempts to replicate the findings observed in Reanalysis 2 and tests new predictions from the response threshold model. </span><span class="sentence">In both experiments, the responses are manual (i.e., key press) rather than verbal.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Thirty-four University of Waterloo undergraduates participated in Experiment 1 in exchange for course credit.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All stimuli were presented on a standard computer monitor and responses were made on a QWERTY keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">Participants pressed the <em>F</em> key for “blue” and the <em>J</em> key for “green.” </span><span class="sentence">Stimulus presentation and response timing were controlled by E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, 2002).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There were three display words (<em>SEVEN, GLIDE, CHAIR</em>) and two display colors (blue, green) in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">The words were selected to be of the same length. </span><span class="sentence">For each participant, one of the words (e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>) was presented most often (three out of four times per block) in blue, another word (e.g., <em>GLIDE</em>) was presented most often (three out of four times per block) in green, and the final word (e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>) was presented equally often (twice each per block) in blue and green. </span><span class="sentence">Assignment of words to colors was counterbalanced across participants. </span><span class="sentence">Words were presented in bold 18-point Courier New font. </span><span class="sentence">The RGB values for the stimulus colors were 0,0,255 (blue) and 0,255,0 (green). </span><span class="sentence">There were three contingency levels in the experiment: high (.75; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>blue), medium (.50; e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>blue), and low (.25; <em>GLIDE</em>blue).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There were 420 trials in this experiment, consisting of 35 blocks of 12 trials each. </span><span class="sentence">On each trial, a white (255,255,255) fixation cross (i.e., “+”) was presented in the middle of a black screen for 250 ms.
