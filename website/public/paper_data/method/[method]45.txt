<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">This experiment takes as a starting point Lavis and Mitchell's (2006) demonstration of the intermixed–blocked effect using visual stimuli in humans. </button><button class="sentence">Examples of the stimuli, complex and very similar checkerboards, are presented in Figure 1. Using stimuli of this sort, Lavis and Mitchell showed that discrimination, as assessed by a same–different test procedure, was enhanced after preexposure, in which the stimuli were presented on an intermixed schedule (AX/BX). </button><button class="sentence">Comparison was made with the performance shown to other stimuli (CX and DX) that were preexposed in separate blocks of trials. </button><button class="sentence">In that experiment, the spacing of trials was uniform, which meant that the interval between successive presentations of AX (or of BX) was twice that separating successive presentations of CX (or of DX). </button><button class="sentence">In this experiment we repeated the AX/BX preexposure condition and also presented CX in a separate block of trials. </button><button class="sentence">In this blocked condition, stimulus presentations were massed. </button><button class="sentence">However, presentations of a second blocked stimulus, DX, were separated by an interval corresponding to one stimulus presentation. </button><button class="sentence">Thus, the spacing of DX presentations was equivalent to the spacing of AX (and BX) presentations. </button><button class="sentence">On the test trials that followed preexposure, the participants were required to discriminate each of the compound cues (AX, BX, CX, and DX) from X. We predicted that if superior performance following intermixed preexposure (AX/BX) is due to temporal spacing alone, then the DX stimulus in the spaced condition would be easily discriminated from the common X cue on test.</button><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1.

(43.18 cm) computer monitor and were approximately 8-cm square. </button><button class="sentence">Inquisit, Version 1.32 (Millisecond Software, Seattle, WA) was used to control stimulus presentation on an IBM-compatible PC.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">There were three phases of preexposure. </button><button class="sentence">In the intermixed phase, presentations of AX alternated with presentations of BX. In the blocked phase, all presentations of CX were given consecutively, and in the spaced phase all presentations of DX were given sequentially, but a temporal delay was inserted between each trial. </button><button class="sentence">The order of these three phases was counterbalanced across participants. </button><button class="sentence">Allocation of the stimuli shown in Figure 1 to conditions was counterbalanced such that each stimulus was presented equally as often in the intermixed, blocked, and spaced conditions.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">At the start of the experiment, participants were seated approximately 60 cm from the computer monitor and were presented with the instructions on the screen. </button><button class="sentence">They were told to pay attention to the stimuli, that any stimulus differences they detected would be useful later in the experiment, and to press the space bar to proceed from one trial to the next. </button><button class="sentence">During the preexposure phase, each stimulus was displayed 60 times, for a duration of 470 ms on each occasion. </button><button class="sentence">Each individual stimulus presentation, in both the blocked and intermixed phases, was followed by a blank gray screen during which participants made their space bar presses. </button><button class="sentence">In fact, the following trial was initiated after 2,000 ms whether a press was made or not. </button><button class="sentence">In the spaced condition, the interstimulus interval was increased to 4,470 ms. This is the equivalent of the delay created between each AX presentation by the presentation of BX on alternate trials (and vice versa) in the intermixed condition.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">At the completion of the preexposure phase, participants were informed that in a second phase, they would be presented with pairs of checkerboards, one pair at a time. </button><button class="sentence">They were told to press the <em>A</em> key if these two stimuli appeared to be the same, and the <em>5</em> key on the number pad if the stimuli appeared to be different. </button><button class="sentence">A reminder about which keys to press remained on the screen throughout the test period. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were also told not to spend too long on each judgment.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">There were six types of test trial: (1) intermixed different, in which AX and X (or BX and X) were presented; (2) intermixed same, in which AX and AX (or BX and BX) were presented; (3) blocked different, in which CX and X were presented; (4) blocked same, in which CX and CX were presented; (5) spaced different, in which DX and X were presented; and (6) spaced same, in which DX and DX were presented. </button><button class="sentence">The order of stimulus presentation was randomized across test trials. </button><button class="sentence">Each unique feature (A–D) was presented on 12 trials in total, there being 6 different trials and 6 same trials with each.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Test trials consisted of the presentation of one stimulus for 800 ms, followed by a blank screen for 550 ms and the presentation of the second stimulus for 800 ms. A white square was then presented in place of the checkerboard, and it remained on the screen until the response was made.</button></p> <h4>Scoring</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">A set of planned contrasts using a multivariate, repeated measures model (O'Brien &amp; Kaiser, 1985) was used to analyze the data from this and all subsequent experiments. </button><button class="sentence">A significance level of <em>p</em> &lt; .05 was set for all of the statistical analyses.</button></p>
