Forster, 2003). </span><span class="sentence">There were three phases in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">In the first phase, participants were familiarized with all of the pictures and their names. </span><span class="sentence">In this phase, on each trial, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced with the picture for 2,000 ms. </span><span class="sentence">After 1,000 ms, the picture name appeared beneath the picture and cued the participant to pronounce the picture name aloud. </span><span class="sentence">The second phase consisted of 36 trials in which the experimental task was practiced. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to name pictures or words depending on the color of the word. </span><span class="sentence">If the word was colored blue they were instructed to name the picture; whereas if the word was colored red they were to read the word. </span><span class="sentence">The third phase was the experiment proper. </span><span class="sentence">The trial structure of the second and third phases was identical.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants either took part in the delayed or in the immediate naming condition. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the delayed naming condition were instructed to postpone their naming response until the distractor word was presented. </span><span class="sentence">On each trial in the delayed naming condition, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced by a picture. </span><span class="sentence">After the picture was presented for 1,000 ms, the distractor word appeared. </span><span class="sentence">The pictures and distractor words remained on the screen for 500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">An empty screen was then displayed for 1,000 ms. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the immediate naming condition were instructed to name the picture or word upon presentation (depending on the color of the word). </span><span class="sentence">The trial structure for the immediate naming condition was identical except for the fact that the distractor appeared simultaneously with the presentation of the picture. </span><span class="sentence">The picture and distractor remained on the screen for 500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">The participant initiated the next trial by pressing the space bar. </span><span class="sentence">The duration of the experiment was about 25 min.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Only the picture naming trials were analyzed. </span><span class="sentence">Three types of responses were excluded from the analysis of response times (RTs): (a) naming errors, (b) verbal disfluencies (stuttering, utterance repairs, production of nonverbal sounds), (c) recording failures, and (d) RTs below 300 or above 3,000 ms (immediate naming, 4.7%; delayed naming, 5.3%). </span><span class="sentence">RTs exceeding a cutoff value (defined as a participant's and an item's mean plus three standard deviations) were replaced by the cutoff value (immediate naming, 2.0%; delayed naming, 4.4%).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the analyses reported here we distinguish between by-subjects ( <em>F</em><em>1</em>) and by-items ( <em>F</em>2) analyses. </span><span class="sentence">For the <em>F</em>1 analyses we treat frequency and semantic relatedness as within-subjects variables. </span><span class="sentence">For the <em>F</em>2 analyses we treat frequency as a between-subjects variable and semantic relatedness as a within-subjects variable. </span><span class="sentence">We report separate analyses for the immediate and delayed naming conditions. </span><span class="sentence">An overview of RTs for each naming condition is presented in Table 2.</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-249-tbl2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-249-tbl2a.gif"/><em>Average Naming Latencies in Milliseconds (and Error Percentages) for Immediate (0 ms) and Delayed (1,000 ms) Naming Conditions of Experiment 1</em></span></p>
