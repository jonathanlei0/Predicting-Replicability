<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 5</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We view the projection of responsiveness as a dyadic phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, those who care for a particular partner's welfare and are motivated to provide support to that partner are thought to project this responsiveness onto the partner, seeing that partner as similarly caring. </span><span class="sentence">The projection model does not assume that perceivers are similarly responsive toward all their relationship partners or that perceivers see similar levels of responsiveness from all of their relationship partners. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, the model does not assume that target partners elicit similar levels of responsiveness from all of their partners or that they are perceived as similarly responsive by all of their partners. </span><span class="sentence">In Study 5, we examined in three-person groups the extent to which responsiveness and perceived partner responsiveness are due to perceiver factors or target factors, or are specific to relationships.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Moreover, this group study allowed us to include an informant's perceptions of the target partner's responsiveness to the perceiver as an additional index of the target partner's actual responsiveness. </span><span class="sentence">Using a hypothetical triad as an example, this means that, when predicting Kerry's perceptions of Andy's communal responsiveness toward her, we controlled for Andy's self-reported responsiveness to Kerry as well as Ed's reports of Andy's responsiveness to Kerry. </span><span class="sentence">To the extent that outside observers are less biased (or at least differentially biased) than the target person in reporting on the target person's responsiveness to the perceiver, this allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of perceivers' perceptions and for a more stringent estimation of the projection effect. </span><span class="sentence">(Kerry's own responsiveness to Andy must uniquely bias her perceptions of Andy's responsiveness to her after removing variance shared with Andy's self-reported responsiveness to Kerry and Ed's perceptions of Andy's responsiveness to Kerry.) </span><span class="sentence">Although the partner's self-reported responsiveness and an outsider's view of that partner's responsiveness are each imperfect accuracy benchmarks, together they may present a closer approximation of the partner's true communal responsiveness than would studies of accuracy and projection bias that use only one of these information sources (see also Murray, Holmes, Dolderman, &amp; Griffin, 2000).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In addition, we tested effects of projection of responsiveness on a variety of indices of relationship promotion, including support provision, self-disclosure, and evaluation of the partner. </span><span class="sentence">Through the projection process, those who care for partners may develop the motivation and trust necessary to provide support, disclose personal aspects of themselves, and see virtues in the partner (Path C in Figure 1). </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, we tested whether the two behavioral forms of perceivers' relationship promotion (support provision and self-disclosure) were detected by partners.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Initial participants were recruited via advertisements posted on Internet bulletin boards for participation in an electronic survey in exchange for a payment of $10. </span><span class="sentence">To reduce error variance associated with age, we indicated that only individuals between the ages of 18 and 30 years were eligible for participation. </span><span class="sentence">Those who expressed interest in the study were asked to recruit two other individuals for participation who were between the ages of 18 and 30 years, who knew each other, who did not share a biological or romantic relationship with the initial participant or with each other, and at least one of whom was a close friend of the initial participant. </span><span class="sentence">(They were instructed that the remaining participant could also be a close friend but that this was not necessary.) </span><span class="sentence">Groups in which one or more of the three members failed to complete the questionnaire did not meet the study criteria, and given that the planned analyses required data from all three group members, their data were not included in analyses. </span><span class="sentence">Fifty-three triads completed the questionnaire, but data from two triads and two observations in a third triad were necessarily eliminated from analyses because of missing data on the measures of primary interest, resulting in 304 usable observations in which a perceiver rated the responsiveness of a target and in which data for relevant control variables were available (as described in the <em>Analysis Strategy</em> section below). </span><span class="sentence">The 153 participants included 51 men and 102 women, with an average age of 24.63 years. </span><span class="sentence">Relationships were predominately described as friendships (73.5%), with most of the remaining participants described as coworkers, classmates, or roommates.  Participants were instructed to refrain from discussing the study or sharing their answers with the other participants while data collection was in progress.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Own responsiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants completed two measures of their own communal responsiveness to each of the other triad members. </span><span class="sentence">The first was a 10-item measure adapted from Mills et al.
