<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">EXPERIMENT 1</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">In this experiment, object words associated with an upper or lower location served as cues. </span><span class="sentence">To ensure that the object words unambiguously denoted an upper or lower location, we presented a context word before each object word. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, on each trial, a context word (e.g., <i>cowboy</i>) was followed by an upper-location (e.g., <i>hat</i>) or lower-location (e.g., <i>boot</i>) cue. </span><span class="sentence">Context and cue words were both presented centrally. </span><span class="sentence">A target letter (<i>X</i> or <i>O</i>) then appeared at the top or bottom of the display, and participants identified the target as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence">The target was equally likely to appear at the top or bottom location, regardless of the cue object's typical location. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the cue did not predict the target's location. </span><span class="sentence">If an object word activates a perceptual simulation of the denoted object in its typical location, then target identification should be hindered at that location.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The experimental stimuli were 30 context words, each paired with one upper-location and one lower-location cue word (i.e., 60 spatial cues). </span><span class="sentence">We also included 60 filler stimuli consisting of 30 context words, each paired with 2 nonspatial cue words (e.g., <i>chocolate powder</i>, <i>chocolate shavings</i>). </span><span class="sentence">Participants initiated each trial by pressing the space bar, which triggered a central fixation cross that appeared for 250 ms. The context word then appeared centrally for 500 ms, replaced immediately by the cue word for 250 ms. After a 50-ms delay, a target letter subtending approximately 1° of visual angle appeared at the top or bottom of the screen. </span><span class="sentence">The “top” and “bottom” locations were centered horizontally approximately 8° vertically from the center of the display. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to identify each target letter as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing the appropriate key. </span><span class="sentence">Location cue (upper, lower), target location (top, bottom), and target letter (<i>X</i>, <i>O</i>) were fully crossed and balanced, such that each target letter was equiprobable at each target location, and each target location was equiprobable within each cue condition. </span><span class="sentence">Ten practice trials preceded the 120 experimental trials. </span><span class="sentence">Eighteen undergraduates participated for course credit.</span></p>
