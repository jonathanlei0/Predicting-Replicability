<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On the basis of the preceding analysis, we predict that following commitment to a chosen course of action, relative left frontal cortical activity should be increased, and this increase in relative left frontal cortical activity should be associated with the degree of change in attitudes in support of the chosen course of action. </span><span class="sentence">Previous research has revealed that a commitment to a chosen course of action results in the increase of relative left frontal cortical activity (Harmon-Jones, Gerdjikov, &amp; Harmon-Jones, in press). </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, this commitment (high-choice) caused attitudes to be more consistent with the behavior, as compared with a low-commitment (low-choice) condition. </span><span class="sentence">However, in past research, relative left frontal activation did not relate to attitudes, perhaps because the attitude measure lacked the needed sensitivity (e.g., it did not tap attitude change from precommitment, but only tapped attitudes following the commitment).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In past research, when the psychological process (commitment to a chosen course of action) was manipulated and the proposed physiological substrate was measured (left frontal cortical activation), commitment to a chosen course of action increased relative left frontal cortical activation (Harmon-Jones et al., in press). </span><span class="sentence">To provide stronger causal inferences regarding the role of the left frontal cortical region in following through with the commitment (discrepancy reduction), it is important to manipulate the physiology and measure the psychological outcome. </span><span class="sentence">Manipulation of the mediator also provides stronger causal evidence than simply correlating the proposed mediator with the outcome (Sigall &amp; Mills, 1998; Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005). </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, after participants made a difficult decision, participants' relative left frontal cortical activity was manipulated, and then attitudinal spreading of alternatives was measured.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To manipulate relative left frontal cortical activity, we used neurofeedback training of EEG, also called EEG biofeedback training. </span><span class="sentence">Neurofeedback presents the participant with real-time feedback on brainwave activity. </span><span class="sentence">The feedback can be presented in the form of a video display, vibration, or sound. </span><span class="sentence">If brainwave activity over a particular cortical region changes in the direction desired by the experiment, then the participant is given “reward” feedback; if brainwave activity does not change in the desired direction, then either negative feedback or no feedback is given. </span><span class="sentence">Rewards can be as simple as the presentation of a tone that informs the participant that brain activity has changed in the desired way. </span><span class="sentence">Neurofeedback-induced changes result from operant conditioning, and as such, these changes in EEG can occur without awareness of how the brain activity changes occurred (Kamiya, 1979; Siniatchkin, Kropp, &amp; Gerber, 2000). </span><span class="sentence">This is not to say that it is impossible for a participant to become aware of how she or he caused the changes in brain activity, but research suggests that such awareness requires extensive practice (e.g., 8 weeks of practice; Kotchoubey, Kübler, Strehl, Flor, &amp; Birbaumer, 2002), whereas the changes in brain activity due to conditioning occur much more quickly.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In past research with clinically depressed individuals, neurofeedback training was used to increase relative left frontal activity, and it led to less depression after approximately 27 training sessions (Baehr, Rosenfeld, &amp; Baehr, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">In other research with nondepressed individuals, neurofeedback was effective at decreasing but not increasing relative left frontal activity after only 3 days of training. </span><span class="sentence">The decrease in relative left frontal activity brought about with this brief neurofeedback training caused less approach-related emotional responses (Allen, Harmon-Jones, &amp; Cavender, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of these past results, we predicted that the decrease-left frontal condition would be more successful at changing brain activity than the increase-left frontal condition. </span><span class="sentence">Although past research with normal individuals revealed that brief neurofeedback failed to increase relative left frontal activity, we included this condition to have a proper neurofeedback comparison condition for the decrease-left condition and to give the increase-left neurofeedback another chance to produce significant brainwave changes.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Most important, we predicted that a decrease in relative left frontal activity would lead to a decrease in discrepancy reduction as measured by spreading of alternatives. </span><span class="sentence">To test these predictions, we used the decision paradigm based on the one developed by Brehm (1956).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants underwent 2 days of neurofeedback training designed to increase or decrease relative left frontal cortical activity. </span><span class="sentence">On the third day, after making a difficult decision, they underwent another neurofeedback training session of the same direction as previous days (increase vs. decrease left). </span><span class="sentence">Finally, participants rerated their decision alternatives. </span><span class="sentence">We predicted a manipulated decrease, as compared with increase, in relative left frontal cortical activity would cause a reduction in spreading of alternatives.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Procedures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 33 female introductory psychology students who participated in exchange for extra credit toward their grade on Day 1 and then for $10 per hour on Days 2 and 3. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of past research suggesting that neurofeedback of asymmetrical frontal cortical activity produces effects after 3 consecutive days (Allen et al., 2001), participants were administered 3 days of neurofeedback. </span><span class="sentence">They were randomly assigned to feedback designed to either increase or decrease relative left frontal cortical activity.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After participants provided informed consent and were prepared for EEG recording on Day 1, their baseline EEG was collected for 8 min. </span><span class="sentence">Then, two 8-min blocks of neurofeedback occurred. </span><span class="sentence">On Day 2, four 8-min blocks of neurofeedback training occurred. </span><span class="sentence">For neurofeedback training, participants were told that the activity of their brains would cause a computer to generate tones and that they should try to make the tone stay on, in order to receive more payment. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were not told that neurofeedback was contingent on asymmetry. </span><span class="sentence">No explicit verbal feedback was provided to participants concerning their performance.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On Day 3, after the experimenter greeted participants, she explained that the study would examine the relationship between personality characteristics, brain activity, and preferences for different types of psychological research. </span><span class="sentence">She also explained that we conduct lots of research in the department but have never asked students how much they would like to participate in such research. </span><span class="sentence">She explained that students' preferences for the research may affect their responses in the experiments, so we need to know students' preferences and how personality characteristics related to these preferences. </span><span class="sentence">She then said that because the study is short and will last only 20 min, she would have them participate in another study. </span><span class="sentence">Then, participants provided informed consent.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experimenter explained that in the first study, participants would complete short questionnaires that assess preferences for different types of psychological research. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then shuffled a set of index cards that contained descriptions of nine research projects (attention, attitudes and values, economics, health, law, linguistics, perceptual cognitive, perceptual motor, person perception).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The participants were given the cards and asked to read them in the order in which they were presented and to then rate each project in terms of how desirable it would be to participate in a study like the one described on a 9-point scale (1 = <em>not at all desirable</em>, 9 = <em>very desirable</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were left alone to rate the projects. </span><span class="sentence">When the participants informed the experimenter over the intercom that they had completed the ratings, the experimenter returned to the participants' room and asked the participants to rank order the projects on a separate questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">While the participants ranked the projects, the experimenter, who was in the adjacent room, examined the participants' ratings questionnaire and found which two projects had been rated equally and relatively positively (approximately seven on the 9-point scale), as has been done in other research (Brehm, 1956; Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">When the participants completed the rankings questionnaire, the experimenter returned to the participants' room and explained that some of the studies that were just rated were being conducted now. </span><span class="sentence">She then gave them a choice to participate in one of two studies.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After participants made their decision between two equally rated alternatives, four 8-min neurofeedback training sessions occurred. </span><span class="sentence">Then, the experimenter returned to the participant's room with the cards containing the research project descriptions. </span><span class="sentence">She explained that we were also interested in how familiarity with the research descriptions might affect ratings of the research projects. </span><span class="sentence">She explained that the psychology department was considering posting sign-up sheets that contain more information about the experiments. </span><span class="sentence">She explained that if this change occurred, then by the end of the semester, students may have read the names and descriptions of some research projects many times. </span><span class="sentence">She further explained that the psychology department wanted us to assess how reading the research descriptions repeatedly affects evaluations of the research. </span><span class="sentence">She then asked participants to rate their current preferences for the research projects again.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Afterward, participants completed a questionnaire that asked them to “explain what thoughts, feelings, etc. you had that caused the tone to be played during the biofeedback training session.” </span><span class="sentence">In the end, the experimenter questioned the participants about suspicion and explained the exact purpose of the experiment.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>EEG Recording and Analyses</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To record EEG, five electrodes mounted in a stretch-lycra electrode cap (Electro-Cap, Eaton, OH) were placed on the participant's head using known anatomical landmarks (Blom &amp; Anneveldt, 1982). </span><span class="sentence">EEG was recorded from midfrontal (F3/4) and parietal (P3/4) regions. </span><span class="sentence">The ground electrode was mounted in the cap on the mid-line between the frontal pole and the frontal site. </span><span class="sentence">The reference electrode was placed at the vertex (Cz), as done in past frontal asymmetry neurofeedback studies (Allen et al., 2001). </span><span class="sentence">Vertical eye movements were recorded from the supra- and suborbit of the left eye to eliminate trials with eyeblinks. </span><span class="sentence">All electrode impedances were under 5,000 Ω, and homologous sites (e.g., F3 and F4) were within 1,000 Ω of each other. </span><span class="sentence">Electro-Gel (Eaton, OH) was used as the conducting medium. </span><span class="sentence">Signals were amplified with J&amp;J Engineering amplifiers (I-410; Poulsbo, WA), bandpass-filtered 1-35 Hz, and sampled at 256 Hz. </span><span class="sentence">Alpha power was computed, by bandpass filtering (8–13 Hz) and then rectifying the signals (1-s epochs). </span><span class="sentence">EEG alpha power over the frontal cortices is inversely related to activity over the same cortical regions measured using other methods such as positron emission tomography (Cook, O'Hara, Uijtdehaage, Mandelkern, &amp; Leuchter, 1998), functional magnetic resonance imaging (Goldman, Stern, Engel, &amp; Cohen, 2002), and behavioral methods (Davidson, Chapman, Chapman, &amp; Henriques, 1990; Lindsley &amp; Wicke, 1974). </span><span class="sentence">Recent source localization work has revealed that approach/withdrawal-related frontal EEG alpha asymmetry reflects dorsolateral prefrontal cortical activity (Pizzagalli, Sherwood, Henriques, &amp; Davidson, 2005).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On Day 1, baseline EEG was acquired for 8 min. </span><span class="sentence">After that period, a separate experimenter, who did not interact with the participant, computed the participant's mean frontal difference and standard deviation. </span><span class="sentence">This second experimenter was used so that the experimenter who interacted with participants was blind to condition. </span><span class="sentence">Then, this second experimenter used the mean and standard deviation to establish a criterion value for the next block of neurofeedback training. </span><span class="sentence">The criterion value was the mean of the previous block of EEG recording + 0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>increase-left</em> frontal condition; it was −0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>decrease-left</em> condition. </span><span class="sentence">For Day 2, the criterion value was determined from the mean frontal difference and standard deviation of the last 16 min on Day 1. </span><span class="sentence">For Day 3, the criterion value was determined from the mean frontal difference and standard deviation from all of Day 2.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Thus, for the neurofeedback training, the computer determined the difference in activity between frontal sites and compared this value against the criterion value established from a previous recording. </span><span class="sentence">If the difference exceeded the criterion value in the desired direction, then a tone was played over headphones. </span><span class="sentence">If it was not exceeded, then no tone was played. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to attempt to produce the tones. </span><span class="sentence">Epochs for which ocular activity exceeded 50 μV resulted in no tone for the next 2 s. Similar to past research (Allen et al., 2001), the criterion values resulted in reinforcement on approximately 20% of trials, and the rate of reinforcement was equivalent across days and groups. </span><span class="sentence">In other words, there were no differences between experimental conditions in the participants' abilities to achieve the criterion, and thus, the conditions were equally difficult.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Rationale for Certain Design Issues</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The effect of difficult decisions on spreading of alternatives has been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments (for reviews, see Brehm &amp; Cohen, 1962; Festinger, 1964; Harmon-Jones &amp; Mills, 1999; Wicklund &amp; Brehm, 1976). </span><span class="sentence">In addition, published experiments found significant spreading of alternatives in difficult but not easy decision conditions, using the same decision paradigm as used in the present experiments (Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002). </span><span class="sentence">Thus, following much recent research on spreading of alternatives (e.g., Hoshino-Browne et al., 2005; Steele, Spencer, &amp; Lynch, 1993), we did not include easy decision conditions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Past neurofeedback studies have not included a “no-feedback” condition because of the difficulties in making no-feedback conditions comparable to neurofeedback conditions (e.g., Allen et al., 2001; Baehr et al., 2001; Hardman et al., 1997; Roberts, Birbaumer, Rockstroh, Lutzenberger, &amp; Elbert, 1989). </span><span class="sentence">To be comparable to neurofeedback conditions, a no-feedback condition would need to include “feedback” tones, and participants would need to be told that their brainwaves were producing the tones. </span><span class="sentence">It is likely that such sham feedback and instructions will not be neutral to participants. </span><span class="sentence">Because of the robustness of the spreading-of-alternatives effect following difficult decisions in “neutral” conditions, we did not include a no-neurofeedback-training condition in the present experiment. </span><span class="sentence">If the neurofeedback-induced manipulation of relative left frontal activity caused differences in spreading of alternatives, then the results would support the predictions derived from the action-based model. </span><span class="sentence">The question of whether the neurofeedback training caused increased versus decreased spreading of alternatives relative to a no-feedback condition was not important for the test of this theory-derived prediction. </span><span class="sentence">Rather, the question we wanted to address was, “Does a manipulated change in frontal asymmetry affect the degree of dissonance reduction.” </span><span class="sentence">Also, given the concerns about the difficulty of creating a comparable no-feedback condition, such a condition was not included.</span></p>
