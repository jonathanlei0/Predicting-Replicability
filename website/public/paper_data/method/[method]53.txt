<h3>Method</h3><br/> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Forty-eight students from Cardiff University participated in a mixed-factor design in return for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">All participants reported normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were native English speakers.</span></p> <h4>Apparatus and Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The rhyme-generating program Rhymer (WriteExpress; http://www.rhymer.com) was used to generate words by entering 30 words each with a different but common end rhyme (e.g., “ide” as in “side”). </span><span class="sentence">The monosyllabic end rhymes generated for each word were then chosen and scored for frequency with the Thorndike–Lorge word count (Thorndike &amp; Lorge, 1944) as were the originally entered words. </span><span class="sentence">For each end rhyme, the resultant six highest frequency words were chosen as the TBI auditory items, whereas the 10 lowest frequency words were chosen as the TBR visual items.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This method of constructing and selecting materials differed from previous studies (e.g., Beaman, 2004) for the following reasons. </span><span class="sentence">Items chosen in these prior studies were derived from category norms: Although the common attribute of an end rhyme means that end-rhyme words form categories, we were unaware of any “end-rhyme category norms.” </span><span class="sentence">This is unfortunate to the extent that the dominance relations between the items cannot be determined: We cannot be sure that the highest frequency items are the first items participants will generate when presented with the end rhyme as a cue. </span><span class="sentence">Logically however, there should be a correlation between frequency of use in the English language and dominance level, and because of this, the highest frequency items were chosen as the irrelevant items. </span><span class="sentence">Limits imposed by restricted category sizes forced omissions of items not scored for frequency in the Thorndike–Lorge word count, and the removal of homophones resulted in the use of six words as TBI items and 10 words as the TBR items in each list.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The items within the TBR and TBI sequences were presented in a randomized order that was the same for each participant. </span><span class="sentence">We recorded the TBI items in a male voice at an even pitch at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz in 16-bit resolution using Sound Forge 5.0 (Sonic Inc., Madison, WI). </span><span class="sentence">Each TBI item was then digitally edited to a duration of 500 ms. We presented the TBI items stereophonically over headphones at approximately 65–70 db(A) using SuperLab Pro software (Cedrus Corp., San Pedro, CA).</span></p> <h4>Design</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A mixed design was used with one between-participants factor and one within-participant factor. </span><span class="sentence">The between-participants factor was “Instruction Type,” and participants were assigned to one of two levels: free recall and serial recall. </span><span class="sentence">The within-participant factor was “Sound Condition,” of which there were three levels: (a) irrelevant items phonologically dissimilar to the TBR items, (b) irrelevant items phonologically similar to the TBR items, and (c) a quiet control condition.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The 30 TBR lists and 30 irrelevant sound sequences were divided into two 15-list sets. </span><span class="sentence">For each instruction type, half the participants were randomly assigned to one of the two 15-list sets. </span><span class="sentence">Each 15-list set was further subdivided into five blocks of three lists. </span><span class="sentence">Within each three-list block, the TBR lists were assigned randomly to one of the three sound conditions. </span><span class="sentence">The order of the three sound conditions within each three-trial block was counterbalanced across participants such that an equal number of participants were assigned to each of the six possible order permutations.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">When a TBR list was assigned to the phonologically similar condition, the sound sequence corresponding to the category represented by that list was presented. </span><span class="sentence">When a TBR list was assigned to the phonologically dissimilar condition, the sound sequence was randomly chosen from the 15 categories not represented by the TBR list.</span></p> <h4>Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were seated at a viewing distance of approximately 60 cm from a PC monitor on which TBR items were displayed in a central position. </span><span class="sentence">Lists of TBR items appeared in lowercase black 72-point Times New Roman font one word at a time against a white background. </span><span class="sentence">Each word—whether TBR or TBI—was presented for 500 ms with no interstimulus interval. </span><span class="sentence">The end of the list was notified by the appearance of a red “WAIT” sign that was displayed for 9 s before a green “RECALL” sign was shown to indicate the end of the retention period and start of the retrieval period. </span><span class="sentence">Each of the TBI items was presented three times in the retention period.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were seated in individual cubicles. </span><span class="sentence">They were informed that they would be presented with fifteen ten-word lists and that each list would be presented one word at a time on the computer monitor from which they were asked to memorize as many words as possible and write the words they remembered down on their recall sheets when a “RECALL” cue appeared on the screen.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On presentation of the RECALL cue, participants given free recall instructions were instructed to try and remember as many of the words in any order, whereas participants given serial recall instructions were instructed to remember the words according to their original order of presentation. </span><span class="sentence">Participants from the serial recall group were also told that they could leave gaps in their recall protocols if necessary. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in this group were also instructed to guess the original position if they had an item available to them for recall but could not remember its position. </span><span class="sentence">Recall sheets contained 15 columns of 10 rows each: Participants given serial recall instructions were provided with specially prepared recall sheets with serial positions marked on them; the free-recall-instructed group had the same recall sheets but without the serial positions marked.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were informed that they would have 30 s to retrieve as much as they could of the list and that after this time a tone would sound to signal the beginning of the next list (some 5 s later). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to ignore any sound that they heard through the headphones and were told that they would not be tested on its content at any point in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">On completion of the experiment participants were instructed to return to the beginning of their recall sheets and mark next to an item recalled a confidence rating as to whether they thought that item had been visually presented (1 = <em>guess</em>, 10 = <em>absolutely certain</em>; see Smith, Ward, Tindell, Sifonis, &amp; Wilkenfeld, 2000).</span></p>
