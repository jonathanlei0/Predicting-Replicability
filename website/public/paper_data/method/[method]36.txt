<h3>Study 5––Reduced Motivation or Increased Self-Handicapping?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A remaining question concerns the source of the reduced preparative effects observed when upward counterfactuals concern a self-handicap. </span><span class="sentence">Thus far, it has been argued that this effect occurs because excusing failure leaves the individual relatively more satisfied with the performance and thus less motivated to improve in the future. </span><span class="sentence">A growing literature has demonstrated that counterfactuals benefit future performance only when accompanied by negative affect (Markman &amp; McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; McMullen &amp; Markman, 2000; Myers &amp; McCrea, 2008). </span><span class="sentence">However, it is possible that the effects in the present studies are rather due to an increase in the motivation to self-handicap on the subsequent task.  One could argue that counterfactuals mentioning the self-handicap make this self-protective strategy more cognitively accessible, consistent with past work demonstrating situational priming of goals (Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, &amp; Troetschel, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">Alternatively, because the counterfactual mentioning the self-handicap excuses poor performance, the individual may continue to positively evaluate his or her ability and thus is motivated to continue protecting this self-concept by self-handicapping on subsequent tasks. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, those who have not excused a poor performance would already suffer from lowered self-esteem and thus have nothing left to protect. </span><span class="sentence">Self-handicapping is reduced after failure feedback (Berglas &amp; Jones, 1978; Higgins &amp; Harris, 1988; Thompson, 2004) and is generally construed as an attempt to protect positive yet fragile self-views (Harris &amp; Snyder, 1986; Jones &amp; Berglas, 1978). </span><span class="sentence">Study 5 was therefore designed to examine whether decreased task motivation or increased self-handicapping motivation better accounts for the present effects. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were induced to practice insufficiently and assigned to consider either handicap-related upward counterfactual thoughts or control thoughts, as in Study 3. </span><span class="sentence">However, rather than assessing desire to engage in a behavior that could undermine performance (e.g., reduced subsequent practice or listening to distracting noises), participants' actual effort and performance on the task was measured. </span><span class="sentence">To assess motivation to self-handicap, participants were told that performance on the second exam was undermined by high stress levels and that they would therefore be asked to complete a stress measure. </span><span class="sentence">A number of previous studies have shown that individuals will claim stress as a handicap, and both men and women are willing to self-handicap in this manner (Hendrix &amp; Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991; McCrea &amp; Hirt, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">Thus, if the self-handicapping account is correct, exposure to the self-handicap-related upward counterfactuals should result in higher stress reporting but have no effect on task motivation, compared to control thoughts. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, if the motivation account is correct, there should be no effects of counterfactual thought on stress reporting, but task effort and performance should be reduced after exposure to the self-handicap-related upward counterfactuals.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 28 (14 women, 14 men) University of Konstanz students. </span><span class="sentence">They either were paid €5 or received credit in return for participation and were randomly assigned to one of two thought conditions (handicap vs. control) in a between-subjects design.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The design was adapted from Study 3. </span><span class="sentence">The observation of participants via camera was eliminated given that this manipulation proved unnecessary in Study 4. </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem inventory as part of a prescreening measure. </span><span class="sentence">Upon arrival to the laboratory, they were told the experiment involved factors influencing math performance and completed a consent form. </span><span class="sentence">After receiving the practice instructions, participants completed an initial 2-min (insufficient) practice session, the first math exam, and received failure feedback. </span><span class="sentence">Following exposure to either the handicap-related (i.e., lack of practice) upward counterfactual thoughts or the control thoughts, participants were given instructions concerning a surprise second math exam. </span><span class="sentence">They were told that the second exam includes a time component and therefore is strongly affected by one's current ability to concentrate. </span><span class="sentence">Individuals experiencing stress in their lives can become distracted and, as a result, not perform as well. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were therefore asked to complete a 32-item stress inventory (adapted from Kanner, Coyne, Schaeffer, &amp; Lazarus, 1981). </span><span class="sentence">This measure served as an assessment of self-handicapping (see also Hendrix &amp; Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Following the stress inventory, participants began the second math exam. </span><span class="sentence">The number of items attempted and the number correctly answered in a 4-min period were recorded. </span><span class="sentence">Participants then completed manipulation checks as in previous studies.</span></p>
