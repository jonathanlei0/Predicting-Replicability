<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><div class="head-b"><h3>Participants</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Seventeen young and 17 older adults with no history of neurological or psychiatric impairment gave informed written consent in a manner approved by the Harvard Institutional Review Board. </span><span class="sentence">Data from 1 young adult and 1 older adult were excluded because of technical difficulties; thus, data from 16 young and 16 older adults are presented. </span><span class="sentence">In a session separate from that described next, all older adults completed a neuropsychological battery (see Table 1 for a summary of the results of this testing, as well as the two groups' demographics).</span></p><div class="NLM_table-wrap"><div class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel">TABLE 1</span> <i>Demographic and Neuropsychological Characteristics of the Participants</i></p></div><img src="/paper_data/img/10.1111_j.1467-9280.2008.02043.x-table1.jpeg" alt="" id="_i3"/></div><div class="head-b"><h3>Adapted AI</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants completed an adapted version of the AI that probed events from both the past and the future. </span><span class="sentence">In each of four conditions (past few weeks, past few years, next few weeks, and next few years), participants generated eight events in response to randomly presented cue words (Crovitz &amp; Schiffman, 1974). </span><span class="sentence">Although studies with young adults have sampled events further into the past or future (e.g., 20 years in Addis et al., 2007), the advanced age of the older adults meant that this was not feasible in the current study. </span><span class="sentence">Both time periods (weeks and years) for one temporal direction (past or future) were completed before the conditions in the other temporal direction began. </span><span class="sentence">Conditions were blocked in this manner to reduce load and facilitate older adults' understanding of the instructions for each condition. </span><span class="sentence">Order of presentation of temporal direction and time periods was counterbalanced.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Stimuli</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The cues were 32 nouns taken from Clark and Paivio's (2004) extended norms. </span><span class="sentence">All cues were high in Thorndike-Lorge frequency (<i>M</i> = 1.72, <i>SD</i> = 0.26), imageability (<i>M</i> = 5.92, <i>SD</i> = 0.35), and concreteness (<i>M</i> = 6.83, <i>SD</i> = 0.29). </span><span class="sentence">They were divided into four lists of eight nouns matched for these variables. </span><span class="sentence">Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed that the lists did not differ significantly in frequency, <i>F</i>(3, 28) = 0.02, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> = .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .002; imageability, <i>F</i>(3, 28) = 0.06, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> = .07, η<sup>2</sup> = .006; or concreteness, <i>F</i>(3, 28) = 1.80, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> = .75, η<sup>2</sup> = .16. </span><span class="sentence">Lists of cue words cycled through conditions in a fully counterbalanced design. </span><span class="sentence">Each participant was randomly assigned to a counterbalanced version.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Interview</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">On each trial, participants were instructed to recall or imagine an event and to generate as much detail about that event as possible within a 3-min time limit. </span><span class="sentence">The event generated in response to a cue word did not have to strictly involve the named object; participants were encouraged to freely associate so that they would be successful in generating an event. </span><span class="sentence">Each event was required, however, to be temporally and contextually specific (i.e., episodic), occurring over minutes or hours, but not more than 1 day. </span><span class="sentence">Future events had to be plausible, given the participant's plans, and novel, that is, not previously experienced by the participant. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to try to experience events from a field perspective (i.e., from the perspective of being there) rather than an observer perspective (i.e., from an external vantage point in which they observed themselves).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">For the duration of each trial, the relevant cue word was displayed on a computer screen along with the task instruction (“recall past event” or “imagine future event”) and time period. </span><span class="sentence">When necessary, general probes were given to clarify instructions and encourage further description of details. </span><span class="sentence">After 3 min, a bell sounded to indicate the end of the trial. </span><span class="sentence">The participant then dated the event and rated it on 5-point scales for level of detail (1 = <i>vague with no/few details</i>, 5 = <i>vivid</i>; for brevity, results for this variable are not discussed, given that more extensive measures of detail were obtained using the AI), emotionality (i.e., intensity of emotion experienced upon recalling or imagining the event; 1 = <i>nonemotional</i>, 5 = <i>highly emotional</i>), and personal significance (i.e., how life-changing the event was or would be; 1 = <i>insignificant</i>, 5 = <i>life-changing</i>). </span><span class="sentence">The interview took approximately 2.5 hr. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually, and responses were recorded using a digital audio recorder so that they could be transcribed later.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Scoring</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The standardized AI scoring procedure (Levine et al., 2002) was used. </span><span class="sentence">For each participant, events generated in response to the first four randomly presented cue words in each condition were scored by one of three scorers. </span><span class="sentence">First, the central event was identified; if more than one event was mentioned, the event that was discussed in most detail and that occurred over a brief time frame was selected as the central event. </span><span class="sentence">The transcription was then segmented into distinct details, or chunks of information (e.g., a unique occurrence or thought), and these details were categorized as <i>internal</i> (episodic information relating to the central event) or <i>external</i> (nonepisodic information, including semantic details and information concerning extended events that are not specific in time and place, and repetitions). </span><span class="sentence">For each event, the numbers of internal and external details were tallied, and the totals were then averaged across the four events in each condition to create internal and external AI scores for each condition for each participant. </span><span class="sentence">Interrater reliability of scoring, established on the basis of 20 events scored by all three raters and an intraclass correlation analysis, was high (two-way mixed model; standardized Cronbach's α = .96 for internal AI scores and .92 for external AI scores). </span><span class="sentence">Note that all scorers were blind to group membership, but given that event content could imply group membership, we ensured that the principal scorer (who scored 288 of the 512 event transcripts) was blind to the hypotheses of this study.</span></p>
