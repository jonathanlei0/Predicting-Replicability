<h3>Studies 1A and 1B</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The crucial mediator in our hypothesized path from values to resistance is amount of message processing. </span><span class="sentence">Message recipients might think more carefully about the content of a message if they expect that information to relate to values they hold as relatively important rather than unimportant (cf. Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1990). </span><span class="sentence">Our first two experiments addressed whether consideration of a message in relation to important rather than unimportant values influences the level of message processing. </span><span class="sentence">We expected that consideration of important values would lead to greater processing (elaboration) than consideration of unimportant values. </span><span class="sentence">To address this question, we adapted the paradigm used by Ostrom and Brock (1969; see also Murray et al., 1996) in which participants are randomly assigned to consider normatively important or unimportant values in relation to a persuasive message about a topic of low personal relevance to the message recipients. </span><span class="sentence">To index the level of processing of the persuasive message, we created two versions of the persuasive message, one that contained relatively strong (compelling) arguments and one that contained relatively weak (specious) arguments. </span><span class="sentence">When processing is high rather than low, there should be larger effects of argument quality on attitudes and on the favorability of thoughts toward the attitude object (see Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One hundred forty-four introductory psychology students participated in Study 1A, and 79 participated in Study 1B. </span><span class="sentence">Students were randomly assigned to conditions of a 2 (value: important vs. unimportant) × 2 (argument quality: strong vs. weak) between-participants design.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to relate values to a message, reported attitudes on the topic, and listed the thoughts that came to mind while reading the message. </span><span class="sentence">First, participants received a booklet presenting a written message containing either strong or weak arguments arguing that a fictitious country, Tashkentistan, should be allowed to join the European Union (EU). </span><span class="sentence">After viewing the message for the first time, participants were asked to engage in a “speech interpretation task.” </span><span class="sentence">Participants read three 3- to 4-sentence excerpts (paragraphs) from the message, each listed separately on a page along with an “idea” (i.e., a value). </span><span class="sentence">The value had been identified in pretests as normatively important or unimportant. </span><span class="sentence">Each message paragraph was created such that some elements were related to both the important and the unimportant values that were associated (in different conditions) with the excerpt. </span><span class="sentence">For each excerpt, participants were asked to circle the value and to circle a keyword in the excerpt that was most related to the value, connecting the two circled words by drawing a line between them. </span><span class="sentence"> After the speech interpretation task, participants were asked to report their attitudes toward Tashkentistan entering the EU and to list the thoughts that came to mind when reading the message.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two differences existed between Studies 1A and 1B. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in Study 1A (but not Study 1B) were asked to rate how appropriate the idea (value) was to the excerpt after drawing a link between each idea and a word in the excerpt (following Ostrom &amp; Brock, 1969). </span><span class="sentence">This rating ensured that both important and unimportant values were perceived as having equal fit to their associated paragraphs. </span><span class="sentence">Also, after reporting their attitudes but before the thought listing, Study 1B participants were asked to report how closely their attitudes were related to their core, self-defining values (using items from a past measure of value-relevance of attitudes; Boninger et al., 1995; Holbrook et al., 2005).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Independent Variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Value importance</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In a pretest, three values (adopted from Schwartz, 1992) were identified as normatively important (i.e., self-respect, <em>M</em> = 8.11; loyalty, <em>M</em> = 8.15; and freedom, <em>M</em> = 8.44, on a 9-point scale with 1 = <em>not at all important</em> and 9 = <em>very important</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Three other values were identified as normatively less important (i.e., wealth, <em>M</em> = 5.41; social power, <em>M</em> = 5.70; and unity, <em>M</em> = 5.19).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Argument quality</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The message contained three arguments pretested to be either relatively cogent and compelling or relatively weak and specious in their support of Tashkentistan’s admittance into the EU (see Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986, regarding pretesting procedures). </span><span class="sentence">One example strong argument described a strong Tashkentistani economy:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">The economy has shown improvement in the past few years, and will continue to show even more if it becomes an EU participant. </span><span class="sentence">Unemployment has decreased and independence from government-assisted living has increased over the past few years, in part due to the construction of high-quality fishing ports that are capable of bringing in tons of fish per day.</span></blockquote><span class="sentence"> The argument went on to say that this strong Tashkentistani economy would benefit the EU. In contrast, in the weak argument conditions, the Tashkentistani economy could only be viewed as benefiting from the EU, not the other way around:</span><blockquote><span class="sentence">Inclusion of a country into the EU leads to a chance at independence from outside influence, by providing security for the new country and changing its monetary system into the EU’s. EU members will aid in the building of new seaside ports, resulting in an extra hundred pounds of fish caught per week.</span></blockquote><span class="sentence"> However, this EU support for Tashkentistan was also described as coming at a price to EU countries.</span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Within each argument, there were words that related to values pretested as important (i.e., self-respect) and unimportant (i.e., wealth). </span><span class="sentence">Yet the messages did not explicitly tie support for the advocacy to any of the values. </span><span class="sentence">That is, the messages did not say that supporting Tashkentistan would support self-respect or would support wealth. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, the task of linking the value with a word from the message need not create attitudes viewed as expressing or representing the values.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Dependent Variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Appropriateness of values</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 1A participants were asked to rate how appropriate each value was for its message excerpt using a 9-point scale (1 = <em>not at all appropriate</em>, 9 = <em>very appropriate</em>).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Attitudes</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants reported their attitude toward Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU on five semantic 9-point differential scales (1 = <em>harmful, foolish, bad, unfavorable</em>, and <em>undesirable</em>; 9 = <em>beneficial, wise, good, favorable</em>, and <em>desirable</em>, respectively), as well as rating how strongly they agreed with the message (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>, 9 = <em>strongly agree</em>; see Wegener &amp; Fabrigar, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">The Cronbach’s alpha for these six items was .92 for Study 1A and .94 for Study 1B.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Thought favorability</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After completing the attitude measures, participants completed a thought listing task. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were given 3 min to write down any thoughts they had while reading the message (see Wegener, Downing, Krosnick, &amp; Petty, 1995, for specific instructions). </span><span class="sentence">Two judges, unaware of condition, categorized participants’ thoughts as positive, negative, or neutral toward admitting Tashkentistan to the EU. Thought favorability was computed by subtracting the number of negative thoughts from the number of positive thoughts and dividing by the total number of thoughts related to the topic. </span><span class="sentence">Thought favorability indices for the two judges were highly correlated (Study 1A, <em>r</em> = .93; Study 1B, <em>r</em> = .89), so they were averaged to form a single measure of thought favorability.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Value relevance</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Study 1B, after the attitude measure but before the thought listing, participants were asked to report the extent to which their attitude was related to their core, personal values. </span><span class="sentence">Similar to Holbrook et al. (2005; see also Boninger et al., 1995), participants were asked the extent to which Tashkentistan entering the EU (a) is related to their personal values (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 9 = <em>very much</em>; 1 = <em>does not at all reflect</em>, 9 = <em>very much reflects</em>), (b) is based on the values they care about the most (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 9 = <em>very much</em>; 1 = <em>does not at all reflect</em>, 9 = <em>very much reflects</em>), (c) has an impact on the values they care about the most (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 9 = <em>very much</em>; 1 = <em>does not at all reflect</em>, 9 = <em>very much reflects</em>), and (d) reflects their core values (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 9 = <em>very much</em>; 1 = <em>does not at all reflect</em>, 9 = <em>very much reflects</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The Cronbach’s alpha for the eight items was .95.</span></p>
