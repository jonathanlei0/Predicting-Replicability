In the physical comparison task, participants are asked to choose the physically larger digit while ignoring <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitude. Automaticity of <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitude is indicated by the size congruency effect (SiCE), which is indicated in poorer performance in the incongruent condition (when the physically larger digit is numerically smaller) than in the congruent condition (when the physically larger digit is also numerically larger; e.g., <a href="#c9">Henik &amp; Tzelgov, 1982</a>; <a href="#c15">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</a>; <a href="#c24">Tzelgov, Meyer, &amp; Henik, 1992</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The SiCE is viewed as indicating that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitudes of the two presented digits were automatically processed and compared with each other. Some studies (e.g., <a href="#c7">Ganor-Stern et al., 2007</a>) found that the SiCE increased with larger intrapair <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference, thus suggesting also the activation of the whole number line (see <a href="#c23">Tzelgov &amp; Ganor-Stern, 2005</a>, for a discussion of this point). However, this interaction of the SiCE and <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference was not always obtained (e.g., <a href="#c20">Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, &amp; Shahar-Shalev, 2002</a>). In the present study, we look at the SiCE (i.e., the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent conditions) and at its interaction with <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference for both same- and different-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, participants also performed the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison task in which they had to select the numerically larger digit. The analysis of this task mainly focused on the CDE with same- and different-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-430-ID0ECCCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. All of them were native speakers of Arabic, who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli set was composed by all the possible 28 pairs created from two different numbers in the range of 1–9, excluding 5. There were thus eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> differences, ranging from 1–8. Each number pair appeared in the following three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian pairs and Indian–Arabic pairs). Each of the pairs appeared twice, once with the larger number on the left side and the other with the smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 224 trials. Each number was about 15 mm high and 10 mm wide, and the distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the physical comparison task, the numbers presented were in one of two physical sizes: large (18 × 11 mm) and small (12 × 8 mm). Each number pair appeared four times: twice in the congruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically larger size) and twice in the incongruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically smaller size). In addition, within each congruency condition, each pair appeared once with the numerically larger number on the left side and once with the numerically smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 448 trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted on a Pentium IBM clone personal computer with a 14-in. [35.56-cm] monitor screen. The experiment was programmed in E-Prime software (<a href="#c21">Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2002</a>)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the physical and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison tasks. The order of tasks was counterbalanced <strong data-auto="strong_text">across</strong> participants. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then two numbers appeared, each was 3 cm apart from the screen center. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison task, participants were required to select the numerically larger digit. In the physical comparison task, they had to select the physically larger digit while ignoring <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitudes. Participants responded by pressing either the “L” key for the right number or the “A” key for the left one. In both tasks, participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. The numbers remained on the screen until the participant's response.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-430-ID0EBCCAA"> </a>
