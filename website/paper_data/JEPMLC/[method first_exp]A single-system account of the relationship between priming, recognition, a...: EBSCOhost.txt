An <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> replication was conducted rather than simply fitting the model to Stark and McClelland's data because robust demonstrations of <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> in the absence of awareness remain elusive, and independent replications of such effects are therefore important.<a id="b-fn1"> </a> We presented words at study using the CID procedure; participants pressed a button when they could identify the word and then named the word aloud. At test, we presented old and new words to participants using the CID-R procedure.</p><a id="xlm-34-1-97-ID0EBECAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-four individuals were recruited through a University College London participant database. Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 years, with a mean of 23.3 years. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported English as their first language, were tested individually in sound-dampened cubicles, and were paid £4 (approximately $7) in return for taking part. The experiment was fully automated, and the experimenter was not present in the room during the course of the experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A total of 120 words were selected with similar constraints to <a href="#c47">Stark and McClelland (2000)</a>: All words had four letters, had a frequency of occurrence of 10–200 per million (<a href="#c23">Kucera &amp; Francis, 1967</a>), and had a maximum score of 500 on the Imagability and Concreteness scales in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic database (<a href="#c5">Coltheart, 1981</a>). All words were presented in white 20-pt Courier font. Two 50-word lists were constructed. Each word list acted as the old or new stimuli, counterbalanced across participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At study, a <strong data-auto="strong_text">single</strong> word was presented on each CID trial. At the start of each trial, a mask (a row of hash marks ####) was presented for 500 ms to orient the participant. Next, a word was presented in lowercase 20-pt Courier font for 17 ms. The mask was then presented in 26-pt Courier font for 233 ms, forming a 250-ms presentation block. The word was then immediately presented again, but this time the exposure duration was increased by 17 ms, and the mask followed for the remainder of the 250-ms presentation block. Presentation continued in this way, with the total stimulus plus mask time remaining constant in each block, until the mask duration was 0 ms (15 blocks). When a response was made (by clicking the left mouse button), the mask was immediately presented for 2,000 ms. Participants then clicked a button that was presented below the stimulus presentation area to advance to the next trial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were 70 study trials in total. The first and last 10 trials were considered primacy and recency filler trials, and none of the words from these trials appeared at test. The RTs from these filler trials were not included in any subsequent analysis. The remaining 50 trials contained the stimuli that would later appear at test. For the study phase, participants were told that a word would flash on the screen for longer and longer durations and that this would make it appear clearer over time. They were told that they must click the left mouse button when they knew the identity of the word and then read it aloud. On each trial, the time from the onset of the stimuli to the onset of the button press was recorded. The importance of speed was emphasized; however, errors were discouraged: Participants were told that they should click the mouse button only when they were confident that they could identify the word correctly. If the word had not been identified by the end of the trial, then a message appeared to the participants asking them to try to be faster on the next trial. RTs longer than 3,750 ms (the time that had elapsed by the end of the last stimulus presentation block) were not recorded. No indication of the upcoming recognition test was given.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After the study phase, the instructions for the test phase were presented. We presented a <strong data-auto="strong_text">single</strong> word using the CID procedure on each test trial. Participants were again instructed to press the mouse button when they could identify the word and then read the word aloud; they were additionally told that after identifying each word they would have to make a judgment about the word. After each identification, the probe “old or new?” appeared on the screen, and two buttons labeled “old” and “new” were also presented on the screen below this probe. Participants were instructed to click the button labeled “old” if they thought that the word they had just identified was one from the study phase. They were told to click the “new” button if they thought that the word had not been presented in the study phase. There were 100 test trials in total (50 old and 50 new trials). The selection of a word for each trial was randomly determined. Misidentification trials at study or test were excluded from all subsequent analysis. Responses were recorded on a tape recorder and later checked for accuracy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An alpha level of .05 was used for statistical tests, and <em>t</em> tests were two-tailed. We used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction to correct for nonsphericity on tests involving repeated measures factors with more than two levels.</p><a id="xlm-34-1-97-ID0EAECAA"> </a>
