<span class="sentence">      How do youths' personality reports differ from those of adults? To identify the year-by-year timing of developmental trends from late childhood (age 10) to early adulthood (age 20), the authors examined Big Five self-report data from a large and diverse Internet sample. </span><span class="sentence">At younger ages within this range, there were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced effects on psychometric characteristics. </span><span class="sentence">Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages. </span><span class="sentence">Importantly, however, different Big Five domains showed different developmental trends. </span><span class="sentence">Extraversion showed especially pronounced age gains in coherence but no gains in differentiation. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed large age gains in differentiation but only trivial gains in coherence. </span><span class="sentence">Neuroticism and Openness showed moderate gains in both coherence and differentiation. </span><span class="sentence">Comparisons of items that were relatively easy versus difficult to comprehend indicated that these patterns were not simply due to verbal comprehension. </span><span class="sentence">These findings have important implications for the study of personality characteristics and other psychological attributes in childhood and adolescence.</span>
