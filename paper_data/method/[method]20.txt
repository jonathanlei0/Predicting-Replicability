<h3>Study 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We examined ERNs associated with stereotype-response control among low-prejudice participants characterized by high internal motivation (but low external motivation) versus those with a combination of high internal and high external motivation, as well as high-prejudice participants characterized by low internal motivation. </span><span class="sentence">To create groups that were highly representative of these profiles, we recruited participants with IMS and EMS scores in the upper or lower thirds of the participant pool (Alloy, Abramson, Raniere, &amp; Dyller, 1999; Amodio et al., 2003). </span><span class="sentence">The extreme-groups approach was critical for obtaining a true low-IMS group, because IMS scores were highly positively skewed in this sample. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, we combined low-IMS participants who reported either high or low levels of EMS, because their responses, which were to be made in private (i.e., without external pressures), were not theorized to differ (Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002; Plant &amp; Devine, 1998). </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that high-IMS/low-EMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants would report similar pro-Black attitudes, yet high-IMS/low-EMS participants would exhibit greater response control on the weapons-identification task relative to high-IMS/high-EMS participants. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, we predicted that this difference would be explained by the degree of conflict-monitoring activity during responses in which automatic stereotypes conflicted with intentions. </span><span class="sentence">We expected to observe relatively low activity of the conflict-monitoring process among high-IMS/high-EMS participants when automatic stereotypes are activated, because their egalitarian intentions are not believed to be represented at the same automatic level of processing and thus would not create conflict. </span><span class="sentence">Last, low-IMS participants were expected to show a low degree of response control, coupled with low engagement of conflict-monitoring processes on stereotype-related trials. </span><span class="sentence">A low degree of conflict was expected because stereotypic responses are consistent with their prejudiced beliefs.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To conduct a strong test of our hypothesis, it was important to use a task that would elicit similar levels of automatic race-biased tendencies across groups. </span><span class="sentence">Our past work showed that high-IMS/low-EMS participants exhibited lower levels of implicit bias than other groups on measures assessing affective/evaluative forms of bias (Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002). </span><span class="sentence">However, high-IMS/low-EMS participants did not differ from other participants when implicit stereotype associations were measured (Amodio, Stahlhut, &amp; Devine, 2002). </span><span class="sentence">This distinction is consistent with research suggesting that implicit stereotyping reflects different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms than do affect-driven forms of implicit bias (Amodio &amp; Devine, 2006). </span><span class="sentence">Because the weapons identification task elicits response biases that are driven primarily by stereotype associations rather than by affective responses, it was particularly well-suited for testing our hypothesis (Judd, Blair, &amp; Champleau, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">In addition, we chose to focus on PD estimates of automaticity and control as our primary behavioral outcomes. </span><span class="sentence">Although reaction times and error rates have been used to indicate automatic and controlled response patterns in much past work, it is likely that any given response involves some combination of automatic and controlled processes, and thus raw measures of reaction time and accuracy do not provide process-pure indicators of automaticity and control (Jacoby, 1991). </span><span class="sentence">The validity of the PD procedure in the context of prejudice has been established in several published articles (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004; Judd et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2002; Lambert et al., 2003), and the assumption of independent processes for automaticity and control is consistent with research identifying their separate neural substrates (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004, 2006; Cunningham et al., 2004).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Seventy-three psychology students at the University of Wisconsin—Madison participated individually in exchange for extra course credit. </span><span class="sentence">We selected right-handed female participants to control for variability in physiological responses associated with sex and handedness (Heller &amp;
