<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To examine the possibility that an informed guessing strategy was responsible for producing the outcome of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords, we first needed to replicate this finding. In the majority of Coltheart and Langdon's (2003) experiments, word and nonword trials were presented in separate blocks. Unfortunately, this complicates the interpretation of results from these experiments, because presenting words and nonwords in separate blocks can lead to the use of different strategies for reporting words and nonwords. Accordingly, Experiment 1 was designed as a replication of Coltheart and Langdon's Experiment 6, in which word and nonword trials were intermixed.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. All were native speakers of English; 3 were bilingual.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we selected 72 monosyllabic words and 72 pronounceable nonwords; nonwords were selected from the ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, &amp; Coltheart, 2002). All items were 4 letters in length and were monosyllabic. Orthographic neighborhood size (orthographic N) was included as a factor in the design; half the words and nonwords had an orthographic N of 12 or greater, and the other half had an orthographic N of 5 or less. High-N and low-N words were similar in print frequency (15 per million; Francis &amp; Kučera, 1982). On the basis of the literature investigating N effects in naming tasks (<strong data-auto="strong_text">see</strong> Andrews, 1997, for a review), we did not expect large differences in report of high-N and low-N words, but considering the difficulty of reporting nonwords displayed in RSVP, we expected that high-N nonwords would be better encoded than would low-N nonwords. Thus, we predicted that <strong data-auto="strong_text">it</strong> might be easier to demonstrate RB for high-N nonwords than for low-N nonwords.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The high-N and low-N items were each divided into three sets of 12 items for counterbalancing purposes, and the sets were matched on N and print frequency (mean N sizes per set were 14.8, 14.7, and 14.3 for the high-N words; 13.9, 13.9, and 13.9 for the high-N nonwords; 3.8, 3.8, and 3.8 for the low-N words; and 3.1, 3.2, and 3.1 for the low-N nonwords). Sequences of 3 words or 3 nonwords were created with the first and last words or nonwords designated C1 and C2. These were then made into 6-item RSVP streams by displaying rows of symbols (e.g., %%%%, ####) as the first, second, and sixth items in each RSVP stream. The words or nonwords occupied the third, fourth, and fifth positions in each RSVP stream. Stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used to create the repeated condition, where C1 and C2 were identical. The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting a word from Stimulus set 3 for C1. Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 5 and 12. Two versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 12 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 12 in the low-N repeated condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. The same was true for the 3-nonword lists. Each participant also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2 words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword). Each participant saw each critical word or nonword only once. In both versions of the stimulus list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed. All stimulus items used in Experiments 1 and 2 are shown in the Appendix (additional stimulus items used in Experiments 3–6 may be obtained from Alison L. Morris).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli for all experiments reported in this article were presented on a Macintosh G4 with display controlled by the PsyScope <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> control software (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, &amp; Provost, 1993). The procedure was similar to that of Coltheart and Langdon (2003) except for the mode of response. In the Coltheart and Langdon studies, participants wrote down all the words or nonwords they had seen, whereas in the present experiment, participants named all words or nonwords displayed and the experimenter coded the response into the data file by using the computer keyboard (keys were labeled <em>C1, C2, N</em>, and <em>B</em>, thus providing minimal feedback to participants). In both cases, participants were warned that some of the RSVP lists would contain repeated items, and they were to report these twice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each trial began with a “+” displayed in the middle of the computer screen for 560 ms, followed by a blank interval of 560 ms. The RSVP stream was then displayed with each item appearing for 126 ms. Following the RSVP stream, a “?” was displayed to indicate that the participant should report the items. The next trial began immediately after the experimenter keyed in the participant's response. All stimuli were displayed in a white font (36 pt. Chicago) on a black background. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials were preceded by 10 practice trials.</p>
