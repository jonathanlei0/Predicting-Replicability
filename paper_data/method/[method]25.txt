<h3>Experiment 4b: Feature-Based Learning of Colors</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Would this switch to feature-based rather than object-based processing in the face of reduced covariance between feature dimensions also extend to other dimensions, or might it be peculiar to shape processing? Here, we addressed this question by repeating the familiarization phase of Experiment 4a, but now testing the two color triplets without their matched shapes (Figure 2d).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The familiarization phase of this experiment was identical to that of Experiment 4a, with six of the colors (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F) uniquely paired with one of the shapes from two of the shape triplets, and six of the colors (e.g., G, H, I, J, K, L) randomly presented on each presentation of shapes from the other two shape triplets. </span><span class="sentence">The test phase was similar to the color test of Experiment 2, except that there were only two color triplets from familiarization (e.g., ABC, DEF). </span><span class="sentence">However, a test of only these two triplets would be underpowered since the two triplets could only be tested against two foils (resulting in eight trials: 2 triplets × 2 foils × 2 repetitions). </span><span class="sentence">We could not simply use four foils as before because the triplets would then appear twice as often as the foils during test (confounding the familiarity measure): The likelihood of a particular triplet appearing in a test trial would be 50%, while the likelihood of a particular foil appearing would be 25%. </span><span class="sentence">To avoid this issue while increasing the number of test trials, we also defined two pseudo-triplets from the six random colors (e.g., HLG, IKJ). </span><span class="sentence">The items within the pseudo-triplets were always presented in the same order, similar to the real triplets. </span><span class="sentence">The triplets and pseudo-triplets were then used to construct four foil sequences as in the other experiments (e.g., AEL, DLJ, HKA, IBF). </span><span class="sentence">Each of the “triplets” was tested against each of the foils twice, resulting in 16 trials containing a real triplet and 16 trials containing a pseudo-triplet. </span><span class="sentence">While data from the pseudo-triplet trials were meaningless (since observers had no basis for selecting which pattern was more familiar, as confirmed by chance performance on these trials, <em>t</em> &lt; 1), their presence allowed us to equate the frequency of the real triplets with the frequency of all foils during the test phase. </span><span class="sentence">Data analysis was then restricted to the test trials containing real triplets.</span></p>
