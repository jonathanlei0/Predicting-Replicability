<h3>Experiments 1 and 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The predictions are tested with data from two experiments. <sup/> The only difference between these experiments is that Experiment 1 had about equal numbers of new and intrusion probes among its negative probes, whereas Experiment 2 had only positive and intrusion probes.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In each experiment 30 <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> undergraduates at the University of Potsdam, Germany, participated in partial fulfillment of obligations of a lab course or in exchange for 5 euros (€).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each trial started with the presentation of a row of six square frames in the middle of a computer screen in white on a black background. After 500 ms, six consonants were presented in white, one in each frame, with a presentation time of 400 ms followed by an interstimulus interval of 100 ms for each letter. The two conditions of presentation order, serial and random, were realized in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. In the serial condition, the consonants were presented from left to right; in the random condition, their presentation order was determined at random for each trial and participant. Lists were built by randomly selecting from the 20 consonants (excluding <em>Y</em>) without repetitions. The first probe appeared 600 ms after offset of the last list item in one of the frames (for an illustration, see Figure 1). Participants judged whether the probe matched the letter presented in that frame by pressing the left or the right arrow key; the assignment of the arrow keys to “yes” or “<strong data-auto="strong_text">no</strong>” was chosen by each participant at the beginning of the experiment. The next probe followed 200 ms after the response, for a total of six probes. In the serial presentation condition, the probes were presented in left-to-right order, thereby matching the order of list presentation across the frames. In the random condition presentation of probes followed a new random order independent of list presentation order. Serial position is defined as position in the presentation order.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Experiment 1, across all trials 50% of probes were positive and the remaining ones were negative, with 24% new and 26% intrusion probes. In Experiment 2, each probe corresponded to a different letter of the list; half of them were positive and half were intrusion probes. In both experiments, positive probes were evenly distributed over serial positions across all trials of the experiment in a randomized order, whereas serial positions of negative probes were determined at random without constraints.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each participant completed 12 practice trials followed by 156 test trials (each with six probes) in a 1-hr session. At the end of each trial, participants received a feedback display of the form “X out of 6 correct” and started the next trial by pressing the space bar.</p>
