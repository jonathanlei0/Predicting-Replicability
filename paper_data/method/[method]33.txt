<h3>Study 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Study 1, we demonstrated that a meaningful ending gave rise to the experience of poignancy. </span><span class="sentence">In that study, we used a guided imagery induction in a laboratory setting to evoke poignancy. </span><span class="sentence">Although past research has demonstrated that guided imagery inductions can be used as an effective tool to generate an emotional experience (Gerrardshesse, Spies, &amp; Hesse, 1994), a question remains: Do endings in a natural setting also elicit poignancy? Furthermore, can the salience of an ending be emphasized to amplify the feeling of poignancy? To answer these questions, in Study 2, we surveyed graduating college students about their emotional experiences on graduation day. </span><span class="sentence">For some participants, we emphasized the ending that they were experiencing (limited-time condition), whereas for other participants, we did not emphasize the ending that they were experiencing (control condition). </span><span class="sentence">It is important to note that because all participants were experiencing an ending, we expected feelings of poignancy to be relatively high in both conditions. </span><span class="sentence">However, because we placed emphasis on the ending in the limited-time condition, we expected poignancy to be even higher in that condition than in the control condition.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One hundred ten graduating seniors at Stanford University (49 men, <em>M</em> = 22.06 years; 56 women, <em>M</em> = 21.80 years, and 5 participants who failed to report their age or gender) participated in the study. </span><span class="sentence">Seniors were approached on graduation day, June 18, 2006, and asked whether they would like to participate in a brief survey about their experiences.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Experimental Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 2 was composed of two between-subjects conditions. </span><span class="sentence">In each condition, participants were asked to rate the degree that they were experiencing each of 19 different emotions on a 7-point scale (positive: accomplishment, amusement, contentment, excitement, happiness, interest, joy, and pride; negative: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, embarrassment, fear, frustration, guilt, irritation, sadness, and shame). </span><span class="sentence">In the control condition (<em>n</em> = 59), participants were given the following instructions: “Keeping in mind your current experiences, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions. </span><span class="sentence">In the limited-time condition (<em>n</em> = 51), in which emphasis was placed on the ending that they were experiencing, participants were given the following instructions: “As a graduating senior, today is the last day that you will be a student at Stanford. </span><span class="sentence">Keeping that in mind, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions.</span></p>
