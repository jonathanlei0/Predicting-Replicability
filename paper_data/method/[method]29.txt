Super VGA monitor, and participants' responses were made on a computer keyboard.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The stimuli for the LDT consisted of 200 words, 200 length-matched pronounceable nonwords (Experiment 1), and 200 length-matched pseudohomophones (Experiments 2, 3, and 4; see
Appendix for a full list of stimuli). </span><span class="sentence">One hundred words were desig nated high frequency (mean counts per million = 1,227) and 100 words low frequency (mean counts per million = 44; Lund &amp; Burgess, 1996). </span><span class="sentence">For high-frequency words, the mean length was 4.73 letters (<em>SD</em> = .96), and the mean orthographic neighborhood size (N) (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, &amp; Besner, 1977) was 4.77. </span><span class="sentence">For low-frequency words, the mean length was 4.78 letters (<em>SD</em> = .85), and the mean N was 4.82. </span><span class="sentence">There was no significant difference between high- and low-frequency words with respect to length (<em>t</em> &lt; 1) and orthographic neighborhood size (<em>t</em> &lt; 1). </span><span class="sentence">For the legal nonwords and pseudohomophones, the mean Ns were 3.38 and 4.66, respectively, <em>p</em> = .002. </span><span class="sentence"> For the pseudohomophones, the mean baseword frequency (i.e., the frequency of the word BRAIN for the nonword BRANE) was 647 counts per million.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually in sound-attenuated cubicles under standard lighting conditions, sitting about 60 cm from the computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">After completing a computer-administered 40-item Shipley (1940) vocabulary task, participants were told that letter strings would be presented at the center of the screen and that they were to indicate as quickly and accurately as possible via a button press on the keyboard whether the letter string spelled a word they knew or not. </span><span class="sentence">Twenty practice trials were then presented, followed by five experimental blocks of 80 trials, with mandatory breaks between blocks. </span><span class="sentence">The order in which stimuli were presented was randomized anew for each participant, with clear and degraded trials randomly intermixed within each block. </span><span class="sentence">All stimuli were uppercase and were presented in the 14-point Courier font. </span><span class="sentence">For the degradation condition, letter strings were rapidly alternated with a randomly generated mask of the same length. </span><span class="sentence">For example, the mask &amp;?# was presented for 14 ms, followed by DOG for 28 ms; and the two were repeatedly alternated until the participant responded. </span><span class="sentence">The mask was generated from random permutations of the symbols @, #, $, %, &amp;, ?, and *, with the proviso that the mask be the same length as the string and that symbols not be repeated within a mask. </span><span class="sentence">Each trial consisted of the following order of events: (a) a fixation point (+) at the center of the monitor for 400 ms, (b) a blank screen for 200 ms, and (c) a stimulus centered at the fixation point's location. </span><span class="sentence">The stimulus remained on the screen until a keyboard response was made. </span><span class="sentence">Participants pressed the apostrophe key for words and the <em>A</em> key for nonwords. </span><span class="sentence">Each correct response was followed by a 1,600 ms delay. </span><span class="sentence">If a response was incorrect, a 170 ms tone was presented simultaneously with the onset of a 450 ms presentation of the word “Incorrect” (displayed slightly below the fixation point). </span><span class="sentence">In order to keep the delay between the response to a stimulus and the presentation of the next stimulus constant across correct and incorrect trials, each incorrect response was followed by a 1,150-ms delay.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A 2 × 2 factorial design was used: both stimulus quality and word frequency were manipulated within participants. </span><span class="sentence">The stimulus quality of each item was also counterbalanced across participants, so that there were 50 observations for each of the four experimental conditions.</span></p>
