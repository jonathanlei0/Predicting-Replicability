<h3>Method</h3><br/> <h4>Sample</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 230,047 volunteers who provided personality and demographics data over the World Wide Web. </span><span class="sentence">All respondents were between the ages of 10 and 20 (<em>M</em> = 16.6 years) and were residents of either the United States (90% of the sample) or Canada (10%). </span><span class="sentence">In preliminary data screening, a small proportion (2.5%) of cases was eliminated from the final sample because multiple questions were left unanswered or because the same response was repeated over and over (cf. Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992; Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava, &amp; John, 2004).  This exclusion rate is similar to what we have observed with undergraduate samples (ages 18 to 23 years) recruited from a research participant pool; in such samples, exclusion rates have typically varied between 2% and 5%. </span><span class="sentence">Even after the elimination of potentially suspect cases, sample sizes for each specific year of age were large: 1,754 for age 10; 3,590 for age 11; 6,508 for age 12; 14,310 for age 13; 21,152 for age 14; 27,138 for age 15; 31,272 for age 16; 32,483 for age 17; 36,397 for age 18; 29,317 for age 19; and 26,126 for age 20.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Compared with non-Internet samples recruited for personality and social psychology studies published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> (Gosling et al., 2004), the present sample was split more evenly between male and female participants and was at least as diverse in terms of ethnicity. </span><span class="sentence">Overall, 60% of respondents were female and 40% were male. </span><span class="sentence">Respondents reported their ethnicity as one of seven categories: 12,540 (5.5%) were Asian; 7,684 (3.3%) were Black; 9,895 (4.3%) were Latino; 972 (0.4%) were Middle Eastern; 1,468 (0.6%) were Native American; 178,761 (77.7%) were White; 11,865 (5.2%) reported their ethnicity as Other; and 6,862 (3.0%) did not report their ethnicity.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The sample was also diverse in terms of socioeconomic status. </span><span class="sentence">A question about social class was added during the survey period, and answers to this question were available for most of the sample. </span><span class="sentence">Of these respondents, 11,866 (9.2%) described their parents' social class as working class; 13,586 (10.5%) as lower-middle class; 55,758 (43.2%) as middle class; 43,198 (33.4%) as upper-middle class; and 4,729 (3.7%) as upper class.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Because of the large sample size, all significance tests of individual-level (as opposed to group-level) variables were evaluated at the conservative α = .001 level. </span><span class="sentence">Tests of group-level variables were evaluated at the conventional α = .05 level.</span></p> <h4>Procedure and Data Collection</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The data analyzed here were collected by Jeff Potter via his Web site (www.outofservice.com) and made available for scientific analysis in exchange for authorship. </span><span class="sentence">The outofservice.com Web site offers its visitors free feedback on several surveys and personality measures. </span><span class="sentence">Potential respondents could reach this Web site in a number of ways, including search engines, unsolicited links from other Web sites, and informal channels, such as e-mail and online discussion forums.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Many children and adolescents may have difficulty appreciating the risks and costs of participating in a research procedure, so special care must be taken to protect the welfare of minor participants in scientific research. </span><span class="sentence">For most research involving minors, this includes obtaining the informed consent of parents for their child's participation. </span><span class="sentence">Initially, Jeff Potter—a Web entrepreneur who is not a psychologist or associated with an academic institution—obtained a portion of the present data without seeking review from an institutional review board (IRB). </span><span class="sentence">When the potential significance of this emerging data set became apparent, Oliver P. John and Samuel D. Gosling obtained separate IRB approvals to (a) analyze the then-existing data archive and (b) collect new data. </span><span class="sentence">The present research, including a waiver of parental consent, was approved by two IRBs (a) because the research procedure—anonymously answering questions about global personality characteristics and receiving general and innocuous feedback—involves no more than minimal risk to the participants, (b) because the waiver of consent would not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the participants, and (c) because the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). </span><span class="sentence">More generally, we encourage researchers interested in collecting questionnaire data from minors, whether over the Internet or by other means, to carefully consider the welfare of their participants when selecting the questions to be asked and any feedback to be given.</span></p> <h4>Measurement</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>The BFI</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The BFI (John et al., 1991; John et al., in press; John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) was used to obtain personality self-reports. </span><span class="sentence">The 44 BFI items are short, easy-to-understand phrases that assess personality traits central to each of the Big Five domains. </span><span class="sentence">An example item from the Extraversion scale is “Is outgoing, sociable”; a reverse-keyed example item from the Neuroticism scale is “Is emotionally stable, not easily upset.” </span><span class="sentence">Each item was rated on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 5 (<em>strongly agree</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The brevity of the BFI, and its fifth-grade reading level (Benet-Martínez &amp; John, 1998), make it well suited to a survey of young respondents that expects each participant to devote only a limited amount of time. </span><span class="sentence">In adult samples, the BFI scales have shown high internal consistency, retest reliability, and clear factor structure, as well as strong convergence with longer Big Five measures (e.g., Benet-Martínez &amp; John, 1998; John et al., in press; John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) and substantial agreement between self- and peer-reports (e.g., DeYoung, 2006; Rammstedt &amp; John, 2007).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measuring individual differences in acquiescent response style</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Individual differences in acquiescent responding were indexed with acquiescence scores (within-person response means) computed from a set of 16 pairs of BFI items with opposite implications for personality (e.g., “Is talkative” vs. “Tends to be quiet”; see the Appendix for a complete list of these pairs as well as scoring procedures). </span><span class="sentence">These pairs were selected by Christopher J. Soto and Oliver P. John on the basis of item content and interitem correlations. </span><span class="sentence">An acquiescence score was computed for each participant across the 32 items from these pairs (rather than from the full set of 44 BFI items) because, in the full set, direction of item keying is confounded with personality content. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, all of the BFI scales have more true-keyed items than false-keyed items, although the ratio of true- to false-keyed items varies across scales. </span><span class="sentence">This confound is not present in the set of 16 opposite item pairs, which equates, for each Big Five domain, the number of true-keyed and false-keyed items.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Ipsatized data: controlling for response style</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Ipsatization (or within-person standardization) is the procedure of transforming data so that each participant's set of item responses has the same mean and standard deviation (e.g., McCrae et al., 2001; Ten Berge, 1999). </span><span class="sentence">Many researchers routinely ipsatize their data to control for individual differences in acquiescent and extreme responding (e.g., Ashton et al., 2004; Goldberg, 1990, 1992). </span><span class="sentence">Typically, ipsatization is accomplished by subtracting each participant's mean response (across all items) from each of their individual item responses, then dividing these differences by the standard deviation of that person's responses. </span><span class="sentence">The resulting set of transformed responses has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each participant.  To avoid confounding response style with personality content (as described in the previous paragraph), within-person response means and standard deviations here were computed across the 32 items from the set of 16 opposite-item pairs; these values were then used to ipsatize the full set of 44 items, as detailed in the Appendix.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Assessing the comprehension difficulty of the BFI items: item understandability and trait-word familiarity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two approaches were used to assess comprehension difficulties posed by the BFI items. </span><span class="sentence">First, following Angleitner et al. (1986), 13 psychology graduate students reviewed the BFI items and then judged how difficult each item would be for a typical 10-year-old to understand. </span><span class="sentence">As in Angleitner et al. (1986), psychology students were used as judges because of their familiarity with personality measures and their general psychological mindedness. </span><span class="sentence">These judges were asked to consider both the semantic and syntactic features of the items; an easy-to-understand item was defined as one that is clearly written and uses only basic vocabulary (i.e., words that almost all fourth graders/10-year-olds would know), whereas a difficult item was defined as one that uses more advanced vocabulary or syntax. </span><span class="sentence">Each judge rated each BFI item on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>very easy to understand</em>) to 7 (<em>very difficult to understand</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Across the set of 44 items, the alpha reliability for the mean of the 13 judges was .93.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A second approach to assessing comprehension difficulty focused exclusively on a semantic aspect of the BFI items, namely the unfamiliarity of the trait concepts being assessed: Items that include unfamiliar trait terms are presumably more difficult for respondents to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence">Demonstrating that the familiarity of trait terms can be assessed reliably, Saucier (1997) collected familiarity ratings for 1,248 person-descriptive adjectives from a sample of 112 adult community residents and undergraduate psychology students, using a scale ranging from 0 (<em>I don't know the meaning of the word</em>) to 9 (<em>I know the meaning of the word and think it is used extremely often to describe people</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The alpha reliability of these judgments exceeded .90.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The BFI item phrases were derived from trait adjectives that experts had rated as uniquely prototypical of each Big Five domain (see John, 1990), and so we were able to index the unfamiliarity of each item by matching its personality descriptors to Saucier's (1997) list of ratings. </span><span class="sentence">We reverse-keyed Saucier's original ratings so that high scores would indicate unfamiliarity—that is, items that were more unfamiliar and thus more difficult to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence">For items that included more than one descriptor (e.g., “Is outgoing, sociable”), we indexed overall unfamiliarity as the mean of all adjectives for which ratings from Saucier (1997) were available. </span><span class="sentence">For four BFI items (e.g., “Tends to find fault with others”), the corresponding trait adjectives (e.g., faultfinding) were not included on the Saucier (1997) list, and so these four items could not be used in the present analyses of unfamiliarity.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Examples of BFI items that were identified by both understandability and unfamiliarity ratings as particularly difficult are “Is ingenious, a deep thinker” (difficulty of understanding = 5.15, unfamiliarity = 3.72); “Can be cold and aloof” (difficulty of understanding = 5.15, unfamiliarity = 2.58); and “Likes to reflect, play with ideas (difficulty of understanding = 5.08, unfamiliarity = 3.76). </span><span class="sentence">These items clearly include more difficult language than do three items identified as particularly easy: “Is talkative” (difficulty of understanding = 1.23, unfamiliarity = 1.48); “Is sometimes rude to others” (difficulty of understanding = 1.62, unfamiliarity = 0.76); and “Tends to be quiet” (difficulty of understanding = 1.77, unfamiliarity = 0.92).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">How should these two approaches to defining comprehension difficulty be related? Note that the difficulty-of-understanding ratings took into account both the syntax and semantics of the full item text, whereas the unfamiliarity scores were based only on the individual trait terms. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, the difficulty-of-understanding judges focused on the language skills of typical 10-year-olds, whereas the adults and undergraduates who judged familiarity in Saucier's (1997) research were asked to consider only their own knowledge of the personality terms. </span><span class="sentence">Despite these differences, difficulty of understanding and unfamiliarity were strongly intercorrelated across the 40 BFI items for which the unfamiliarity index was available (<em>r</em> = .48, <em>p</em> &lt; .05).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We also tested whether these two sets of ratings were sufficiently sensitive to children's verbal abilities. </span><span class="sentence">Three elementary school teachers particularly familiar with the vocabulary and reading skills of 10- and 11-year-old children rated how difficult it would be for a typical 10-year-old (fourth grader) to understand each of the BFI items. </span><span class="sentence">Across the 44 items, the means of the teacher ratings correlated very strongly with the means of the graduate student ratings (<em>r</em> = .82, <em>p</em> &lt; .05). </span><span class="sentence">These teacher ratings also correlated substantially with the unfamiliarity scores derived from Saucier (1997; <em>r</em> = .39, <em>p</em> &lt; .05).</span></p> <h4>Gender Differences</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In preliminary analyses, we examined differences between the characteristics of responses made by male and female participants. </span><span class="sentence">At each age, within-domain coherence and between-domain differentiation for males and females differed by no more than two hundredths of a correlation point. </span><span class="sentence">More importantly, age trends in coherence and differentiation were not substantively different for male and female participants. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, specific tests of gender differences are not reported here. </span><span class="sentence">Instead, the confounding of age effects with gender effects was avoided by analyzing male and female participants separately. </span><span class="sentence">In the interest of clarity, all figures plot age-group values as the unweighted average of the male and female values.</span></p>
