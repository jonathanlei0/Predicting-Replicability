# Predicting-Replicability

This project aims to predict the replicability of other papers using laypeoples' data aggregation. 

For instance, will having a large sample size (n > 5000 participants), diverse participants (representative sample), and logically reasonable results (as measured through laypeoples' opinions via Amazon MTurk) predict the replicability of a study? 

Code for the MeteorJS surveying software is included, as are the studies used for training and testing the results. Find the draft research paper attached as well.
