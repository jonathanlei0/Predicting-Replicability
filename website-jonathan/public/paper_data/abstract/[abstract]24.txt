<span class="sentence">      Many models of immediate memory predict the presence or absence of various effects, but none have been tested to see whether they predict an appropriate distribution of effect sizes. </span><span class="sentence">The authors show that the feature model (J. S. Nairne, 1990) produces appropriate distributions of effect sizes for both the phonological confusion effect and the word-length effect. </span><span class="sentence">The model produces the appropriate number of reversals, when participants are more accurate with similar items or long items, and also correctly predicts that participants performing less well overall demonstrate smaller and less reliable phonological similarity and word-length effects and are more likely to show reversals. </span><span class="sentence">These patterns appear within the model without the need to assume a change in encoding or rehearsal strategy or the deployment of a different storage buffer. </span><span class="sentence">The implications of these results and the wider applicability of the distributionmodeling approach are discussed.</span>
